This book picks up where my first book, the best-selling alpha Male Strategies: Dating in the Social Media A ge, left off. We all know how hard it is to get a woman&#39;s attention in the social media age thanks to social media, but once you&#39;ve gotten her attention and built an attachment, it takes just as much skill to maintain that attachment. This is why I&#39;m writing this book. Before I go any further in this book, I want to warn you: I will not be going over the b asics of the game in this book.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The basics, as I like to call them, are how to become a high-value male, to develop an abundance mindset, and to de velop and maintain a masculine frame. I go into detail on these three things in my first book, Alpha Male Strategies: Dating in the Social Media Age. If you haven&#39;t developed those three basic skills I teach, then this book won&#39;t work f or you because it&#39;s written with the understanding that you have fully grasped those areas of your life. Without those three things being in place, you won&#39;t maintain any woman&#39;s interest very long. If you haven&#39;t read Alpha Male Stra tegies: Dating in the Social Media Age, then I suggest you read it first before going any further. This book will be m ore geared toward developing and maintaining an attachment, whereas my first book was more geared toward devel oping yourself and the right mindset to lose your weakness for women.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 01</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women Control the Pace Initially</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A lot of men get frustrated with the way dating dynamics are set up in the beginning. A man has to make the approa ch, the man has to ask the woman out, and the man has to hope that the woman will give him a second date-all while the woman sits back and decides if she wants to give you her number, if she wants to go on a date with you, if she wants to go on a second date with you, and whether sex takes place. It&#39;s safe to say women do the choosing, but why is it that way? Women do the choosing because men are usually sold on a woman&#39;s beauty, while women are sold o n a man&#39;s personality, confidence, and strength. You can say confidence and strength are in the same boat because a man doesn&#39;t have strength without confidence. If a man doesn&#39;t believe 100% in his abilities to replace a woman, he won&#39;t be able to show strength.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even if you wait for choosing signals, it&#39;s highly unlikely the woman pursues you, because feminine energy is not ag gressive energy. Men have to pursue in the beginning because aggressiveness is a sign of masculine energy, which is attractive. Have you ever wondered why a woman who is over-pursuing you from the start usually turns you off des pite you having a high physical attraction? It&#39;s because if you&#39;re a masculine man, a woman displaying that same ene rgy is a turnoff. It&#39;s OK for a woman to pursue you, which could be her initiating a text once a week to tell you good morning, but a woman texting you every morning to tell you good morning the first week you met her is always a tu rnoff. Unlike why this behavior turns a woman off, which is because it shows low sexual market value, masculine en ergy just isn&#39;t attracted to more masculine energy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Be that as it may, as with pretty much anything dealing with the mating dynamics between a man and a woman, eve ntually the men have the last laugh. While women may control the pace initially, men eventually control the pace. A man controls the pace at which he and the woman get into a relationship or marriage if you&#39;re the marriage type. Thi s only applies to high-value men, however. Low-value men propose to women in the hope of making a woman love them forever. Low-value men propose to women, even though the woman has even sent passive-aggressive message s against the idea. When a woman is ready for a relationship, she&#39;ll usually say something to the effect of &quot;What are we?&quot; If you aren&#39;t hearing those words, then there&#39;s a good chance she&#39;s not ready for a relationship. If a woman is re ady for marriage, you&#39;ll usually hear something to the effect of &quot;Is this going anywhere?&quot; Proposing to a woman you haven&#39;t heard that from implies you&#39;re hoping the pressure of saying no is enough to make her say yes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Purple-pill, high-value men want to prolong the courtship as long as possible, although they&#39;re not opposed to a relat</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ionship. Purple- pill, high-value men just recognize a woman with all the qualities they desire, and rather than lose h er once she starts throwing hints, they recognize it&#39;s time to shit or get off the pot. This is not a scarcity mindset, by t he way. It&#39;s only a scarcity mindset if you get into a relationship with a woman you don&#39;t want because you&#39;re afraid of not being able to meet other women. As a purple-pill man, if you do everything right, you should expect a woman to want a commitment eventually. As a red-pill man, I expect it as well; the only difference is, I&#39;m not open to a rela tionship right now unless I&#39;m completely blown away by a woman. Quite frankly, it would require a lot for a woman to blow me away mentally-so much so that I don&#39;t even think that a woman like this has been born. I just find the fa ct humorous of how things switch around so dramatically in the dating game.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 02</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Getting Comfortable</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Getting comfortable is a part of human nature. When you start a job, you usually get to work early initially and are v ery professional at the beginning. Let&#39;s fast-forward two years, and you&#39;re getting to work right before it&#39;s time to clo ck in, and that big, wide smile you once greeted everyone with in the morning is now a subdued head nod, if anythin g at all. You haven&#39;t gotten lazy or antisocial; you&#39;ve gotten comfortable. This is an all-too-common occurrence in re lationships. When you first met your girl, you had this sexy, charming, but serious demeanor that just lit your woma n up on the inside. You were spontaneous and fun to be around. You had the perfect mix of masculinity and just eno ugh of a soft side to have fun. Every evening with you was an &quot;experience,&quot; and she couldn&#39;t wait to see you again. I&#39; ll discuss &quot;the experience&quot; in more detail later.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let&#39;s fast-forward a year, and that strong, sexy, masculine man she fell in love with is now nothing more than a playf ul, immature little brother. You can&#39;t even remember when the last time was the two of you had a fun evening out. A fun evening out isn&#39;t about predictably going to an expensive restaurant every Saturday night. Spending a ton of mo ney doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re having fun. You haven&#39;t stopped liking your woman, but you have gotten comfortable. You can never stop dating your woman. You were a man who had his purpose in life, but now you&#39;ve thrown those plans by the wayside to spend more time with your woman. I know what you&#39;re thinking; isn&#39;t this what my woman wants</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">? No. Correction: hell no! Women get bored easily, and this is a surefire way to ruin the attraction. This doesn&#39;t mea n you have to disappear for two months, but it also means you can&#39;t spend time with your woman every day.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The perfect balance I&#39;ve found that works to keep her off balance is to see her twice a week. Now I know some of yo u reading this book might be married or living with your girl, but the rules are the same. Although you live with you r woman, I don&#39;t recommend spending more than two evenings together, with three being the absolute most. Windin g down in bed before going to sleep doesn&#39;t count. I&#39;m referring to getting off work and spending the rest of the even ing with your woman. In other words, let&#39;s assume you get off work at 5 o&#39;clock, and you&#39;re home by six o&#39;clock. Let &#39;s then assume you start winding down for the night at ten o&#39;clock and sleep by eleven. That would give you 4 hours to spend with your woman. If you&#39;re doing this, it&#39;s just a matter of time before she starts to pull back because she ha s gotten too accustomed to you. It&#39;s just a matter of time before she gets bored and starts lashing out from boredom.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I can&#39;t speak for women, but I know for a fact that most men lose all of their identity in a relationship. When a man f inds a woman he likes, he drifts away from his friends, interests, hobbies, and purpose to spend more time with his woman. No woman wants to be the centerpiece of a man&#39;s life. Women think they want to be the centerpiece, but wh en you make them the centerpiece, they slowly lose interest in you. You want a woman to complain that the two of y ou don&#39;t spend enough time together.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, if she&#39;s complaining because you go weeks without seeing her, then obviously this is too extreme. In dating, p eople tend to go to extremes with dating advice. The correct order should be purpose first, hobbies second, and the woman third. I put the woman ahead of friends because I&#39;m not too keen on hanging with males that often. I think on ce a week with friends is enough. Never get too comfortable in a relationship and lose your identity. When I&#39;m refere ncing a relationship, I&#39;m speaking for rotation girls also. Although you might not be in a &quot;monogamous&quot; relationship</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">, you are, however, in a &quot;non-monogamous&quot; relationship. A non-monogamous relationship is one that guarantees bot h parties, the man and the woman, will see each other regularly without a commitment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 03</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Signs of a Quality Woman</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The number one sign of a quality woman is a woman that&#39;s void of manipulation tactics. I&#39;m at a point in my life wh en if I see any manipulation tactics being applied, I immediately loose attraction. A classic manipulation tactic is wh en a woman gives you full cooperation at the beginning only to pull back a week or two later. This causes men to ch ase not only the woman but also the cooperation she provided at the beginning of the courtship. Some women will e ven go as far as to sleep with you then pull back to get you chasing them. Signs of a quality woman are synonymous with a woman with high interest or a woman who views you as an alpha male, but not 100% completely. A woman could have a high interest at the beginning, which causes her to follow your program initially, but her female impera tive to overly test your masculine core and confidence just gets the best of her. That brings me to my next sign of a q uality woman: testing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re advanced, then you should know by now that women are going to test. The problem is that some women te st way more than others despite you holding the masculine frame and confidence. These kinds of women aren&#39;t reall y trying to test your confidence-their top priority is to be as difficult as possible. Now you can say the being-difficult part in itself is a giant test, and it could be, but regardless of whether it is or not, you want to deal with women who keep testing to a minimum as long as you&#39;re not exhibiting signs of weakness. Some women pride themselves on bei ng a handful. I think the phrase that&#39;s commonly used is &quot;It takes a real man to handle me.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I guess I&#39;m not a real man because I don&#39;t need a woman whose sole purpose for living is testing her man on a consta nt basis. We live in a different society from the one our grandparents lived in. This means that a woman no longer sh ould depend on the man to pay for all the outings and bills if their relationship becomes something more serious. Init ially, yes, but once you&#39;ve engaged in a relationship or have developed a non-monogamous relationship, there&#39;s no re ason the woman shouldn&#39;t pay occasionally. If nothing else, it shows her appreciation for you. It doesn&#39;t even have to be a high-end restaurant, as the thought is what truly matters. If all she could afford was going out for wings, that w ould at least let you know she appreciates you. Some women genuinely believe the only thing they have to bring to a relationship is sexual companionship. A quality woman tries to bring other external attributes to the relationship.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In fact, if you&#39;re a truly high-value man with options, you should almost demand that your woman brings something to the table. If she&#39;s financially unable to take you out, she&#39;ll just cook for you to show you her appreciation. Never p ut a woman in your rotation whose only attribute is sexual companionship. There&#39;s nothing wrong with casually dati ng these women, but it should be kept to that. The difference between a woman in your rotation and a woman your c asually dating is the regularity at which you see them. It&#39;s typical to see a woman in your rotation or relationship at l east once a week. You should only see women you casually date whenever the opportunity presents itself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Chapter 04</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The 5 Levels of Females&#39; Interest</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If you&#39;re reading this book, it stands to reason everything in your relationship isn&#39;t perfect, so I&#39;m going to outline so me common behavioral characteristics so you&#39;ll have a general idea of your woman&#39;s interest and you know where y ou stand. Most men think women are these complicated creatures that are hard to figure out, but in actuality, women tell or show everything you need to know if you&#39;re paying attention.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, most men are delusional or in denial about a woman&#39;s actions. If a woman won&#39;t make a date, it&#39;s not because she&#39;s too busy. The president has time for things he wants to make time for, so what makes you think she&#39;s t oo busy to meet for a drink? Most men don&#39;t want to admit the truth about a woman&#39;s interest level, so they keep pur suing her, or for the guys who are in a relationship, they think just because she was head over heels in love two mont hs ago that her feelings would never change.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As humans, we fall in love, but we also fall out of love. My interest-level scale is going to go from 5 to ten, with ten being the highest interest level. If her interest is below a 5, you should&#39;ve left her a long time ago, because when a w oman&#39;s interest is that low, she won&#39;t be a pleasure to be around. An interest level of 5 is when a woman has a very l ow attraction to you physically. I say&quot;physically&quot; because, initially, that&#39;s all she has to go off of. Fortunately for us men, looks aren&#39;t as important as other attributes, like charisma and personality, so although you might not be able to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;text-align: left;">light her fire physically, you can more than make up for it with your charisma. If a woman perceives you as a beta- male provider, her physical attraction or charisma really isn&#39;t a major factor. I used the term major factor for a reason</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">, because you can&#39;t disgust her or be a weirdo to her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A weirdo is a man who lacks charisma toward that particular woman, although the better provider you are, the more lenient a woman&#39;s grading scales become. For instance, if a woman perceives you as a beta- male provider but you w eigh 4 hundred pounds, and she doesn&#39;t find you that charismatic, $100,000 a year might not cut it for her to be with you. However, if you&#39;re that same guy but you make $2 million a year, all of a sudden your looks and charisma don&#39;t matter as much. For the record, unlike most dating coaches, I have no issue with a man using his success to get laid; I just don&#39;t recommend a man getting into a relationship, monogamous or non-monogamous, with a woman who vie ws him as a beta-male provider. The problem with trying to date women with this level of attraction is that you&#39;re far from a priority. Her attraction is so low that you&#39;re on the bottom ofthe totem pole as far as the other guys she&#39;s dati ng.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This means you&#39;ll probably get the &quot;We&#39;ll see&quot; or &quot;Can I get back to you?&quot; when you try to set a date. It really just de pends on what she has going on in her life. When you&#39;re that low on the attraction scale to her, she won&#39;t make plans with you if she has anything else going on. If you&#39;re a high-value male with a busy schedule, you should jus t put th e ball in her court. Simply respond with &quot;OK, let&#39;s just try to set a date when you know you&#39;re free.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This simple takeaway might raise her interest slightly because it signals that you&#39;re not some desperate loser who&#39;s g oing to sit around and be her backup plan. This shows her you either have other options or that you have a backbone. Either one is extremely attractive. I want to make something emphatically clear: everything I state in this book is no t meant to raise the interest of a woman but rather to help you be a man with principles and integrity. If it raises a wo man&#39;s interest level, then good, but that&#39;s just a by-product. Everything a man does can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t be about attrac ting women.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If your only motivation for trying to obtain financial freedom or the body you desire is solely for attracting women, t hen you can never be a truly high-value male. Don&#39;t get me wrong - I want to look good for the ladies, so I don&#39;t wan t to act like it doesn&#39;t play some role in attracting the opposite sex. Richard Dawkins already has a theory called &quot;the selfish gene,&quot; which states that everything a man does subconsciously is to attract women. While this may be true fo r most men, I can say for myself that women are just a by-product of my desire to achieve success and a healthy lifes tyle. If a woman sees you as a 5, maybe you can try to raise her interest with a short phone conversation or, better ye t, a nice conversation when you meet her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even doing that, your best bet is that she doesn&#39;t have much else going on in her social life. This low interest level al so leaves you very vulnerable to flakes. The women who flake are usually selfish women who make plans with a ma n but who already know he&#39;s a backup plan. In other words, she made plans with you so she had something to do in t he event her other plans didn&#39;t work out. When a woman says, &quot;We&#39;ll see&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll let you know,&quot; at least she&#39;s being courteous enough not to book a date when she knows you&#39;re not a priority to her at that point.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While flaking is a sign of low interest, it&#39;s also a sign of narcissism and selfishness. I know women who are reading t his are going to say, &quot;Maybe something really came up,&quot; but I just find it odd that nothing ever seems to come up wh en a woman has a high interest in men when setting a date. In my experience, when a woman flakes due to legitimat e reasons, she&#39;ll usually accommodate you that same day by either offering to meet later or earlier. She doesn&#39;t usuall y blow you off completely. If you&#39;re in a relationship and your woman&#39;s interest is this low, I can all but guarantee y ou she&#39;s &quot;accepting applications again.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Accepting applications is when a woman is mentally back on the market. I&#39;m not really 100% certain that women are ever completely off the market, mainly due to hypergamy definitely not at this point. Just for the record, so I don&#39;t g et arrested by &quot;the ALL police,&quot; I&#39;m not generalizing, as I know there are some faithful women in the world. There a re always outliers to every rule; there are never any absolutes. I&#39;m just going to speak from my perspective for a mo ment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From my experience, you can raise women&#39;s interest when you first meet them from their initial interest level, but on</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ce you&#39;re in an established relationship, monogamous or not, if her attraction drops, it&#39;s ten times harder to raise it ba ck up. I have a theory for this, and I think it&#39;s the fact that once women see who you truly are, they aren&#39;t buying the change in level.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Is it completely impossible to raise a woman&#39;s interest back up after it dropped in a relationship? The answer is no, b ut it is much harder because she&#39;s formed an opinion of who you truly are. This is why sometimes it&#39;s better to start f resh. If you&#39;re in a long-term, committed relationship and your woman argues about everything, never wants to have sex, and gives you that look of disdain like she hates your guts, that relationship might be unrepairable. In a situation like this, it won&#39;t matter if you got back on your purpose or developed a masculine frame; she&#39;ll always see you as t hat weak, beta male.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Just for the record, if a woman has a level interest of a 5, she most definitely views you as a beta male at that very m oment. Do not confuse a woman arguing and complaining about a lack of you two spending time together with a wo man complaining about you leaving a dish in the sink as the same.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s a &quot;good argument&quot; when a woman is complaining about a lack of quality time compared to complaining about y ou leaving a dish in the sink. Her complaining about you leaving a dish in the sink is nitpicking and really isn&#39;t even about the dish but rather her building frustration and contempt for you as a man as a whole. Her complaining for mo re of your time is actually a sign you&#39;re providing her the emotional motivation she needs to stay attracted to you. W omen need something to complain about, so it can either be her complaining about a dish left in the sink or the lack of time you&#39;re giving her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An interest level of 6 is better than a 5, obviously, but only slightly better. A 6 won&#39;t get you laid or perhaps not eve n a kiss. The woman may give you a grandma-like, modest kiss, but it won&#39;t be a meaningful kiss. Truth be told, she&#39; s probably only on the date because she had nothing better to do. I guess that&#39;s not fair to say, considering it doesn&#39;t r eally matter what her interest in you is; if she had something better to do, then she wouldn&#39;t be on the date regardless</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Women are very selfish with respect to a man&#39;s time. Most women are self-interested. You shouldn&#39;t blame them, as their hypergamous nature instinctively dictates they take the best option &quot;physically&quot; because, initially, that&#39;s all she has to go off of. Fortunately for us men, looks aren&#39;t as important as other attributes, like charisma and personality, s o although you might not be able to light her fire physically, you can more than make up for it with your charisma.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Men largely aren&#39;t like this, as keeping one&#39;s word actually matters to a man. A woman could have an interest level o f a 9 in you, but if she happens to get an invite to Beyonce&#39;s concert at the last second, she&#39;ll all of a sudden get hit w ith the stomach bug-a stomach bug called Beyonce. I know you&#39;re thinking to yourself, why even go on the date to b egin with if she has such low interest?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well, the answer is simple: as mentioned before, her interest level is mostly coming from her initial physical attracti on level and your approach. You could easily raise her interest over the course of the date if you&#39;re confident and cha rming. Let&#39;s not forget compatibility. Men, the majority of the time, always find women compatible. That&#39;s not comp atibility your feeling; that&#39;s lust. Looks always will be what&#39;s most important to men, but women actually listen to th e words that are coming out of your mouth during the date. To women, what you say matters. Things that don&#39;t reall y matter to men, much like interests and hobbies, really matter to a lot of women, especially if you&#39;re not drop-dead gorgeous to her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Of course, physical attraction conquers all as long as you&#39;re confident and don&#39;t blow it by running your mouth too much, but it&#39;s not often that a woman is going to be blown away by your physical appearance alone; therefore, what you say matters. No matter how confident you are, you have to be aware that sometimes a woman just won&#39;t like yo</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">u. For us men, we don&#39;t look for compatibility in order to sleep with a woman, but if you&#39;re on a date with a woman who&#39;s looking for more than a one- night fling, compatibility is going to matter to her. She&#39;s smart and mature enoug h to know you won&#39;t be having sex 24/7, so she wants someone she can relate to. At this interest level, a woman won &#39;t initiate contact because, quite frankly, she doesn&#39;t care if she ever hears from you again.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In this day and age, a woman won&#39;t initiate contact or pursue you at all because women these days are structured in t hat it really won&#39;t matter what her interest level is; she won&#39;t pursue you until she&#39;s somewhat attached.There are diff erent levels of attachment obviously. I don&#39;t say that to be mean, but the facts are the facts, and if a woman has a low interest in a man, she simply won&#39;t put effort into making sure he doesn&#39;t forget about her. An interest level of six ha s a very high-risk flake rate also. When a woman has this kind of interest in a man, sometimes she&#39;ll flake for the si mple reason of being a little tired from the day. That&#39;s right; she would rather watch reruns of The Cosby Show than spend time with you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You should expect that what might seem like a test is in actuality just low interest. That&#39;s another theory I think caus es women to test men. I&#39;m not quite sure it&#39;s testing at all but rather just genuine disinterest. I&#39;ve been on blind dates before, and by &quot;blind dates&quot; I&#39;m referring to online dating, because you never know who&#39;s going to show up. When women showed up looking very different from their pictures, I immediately became a sarcastic, disinterested person. This wasn&#39;t me testing the woman but rather just not being interested.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The good news for a man is that women don&#39;t put nearly as much emphasis on looks as men do, so even if a woman initially has this disinterested look, you can quickly raise her interest with the right personality. The women who I m et online who didn&#39;t look like their pictures didn&#39;t have this same option available, as there&#39;s nothing they could&#39;ve sa id to raise my interest level. I don&#39;t think a woman starts testing until you raise her interest to a level where she&#39;s actu ally considering you as someone she might sleep with in the future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This could be to test your masculine strength, or it could be that, since her interest is so low, she doesn&#39;t care about o ffending you; it just all depends. That&#39;s right; when a woman&#39;s interest is on the low end, you&#39;re more likely to see he r bitchy side. Understand that this doesn&#39;t just go for dating and trying to get to know a woman; it also goes for when you&#39;re already in a committed relationship. If you&#39;re in a committed relationship and your woman&#39;s interest level is t his low, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;re not having sex often, if at all.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In my opinion-and understand this is just my opinion-once a relationship has reached this point, the relationship is o ver.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now the two of you might remain a couple for twenty more years, but that woman&#39;s soul left the relationship a long t ime ago. If she&#39;s the type to believe that a piece of a man is better than no man at all, then she&#39;ll stay. This would me an she&#39;s fallen into a scarcity mindset during the relationship, which is common among couples. A lot of couples cri nge at the mere thought of reentering the dating scene. The problem I have with this thought process is, how happily do you want to live your life? Do you merely want to exist through life, just happy to have someone to have dinner with and to sleep next to you at night, or do you want a mate who lights you up on the inside and who you have pass ionate sex with quite often? Don&#39;t confuse a woman being upset at you from time to time with low interest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No relationship is perfect, and there are going to be times when the two of you don&#39;t see eye to eye, just like when y ou and your friends aren&#39;t always on the same page. The difference is these rifts should be few and far between. If yo u&#39;re having rifts every week, then obviously you need to reevaluate the relationship. You may be able to raise her int erest slightly, but I doubt you &#39;ll ever get it back to the point where she&#39;s head over heels with you again. If just havi ng a mediocre love life is OK with you, then who am I to tell you differently? But for me, life&#39;s too short. An interest level of 7 is when you start to see some semblance of physical interaction with women. This physical attraction coul d be something as small as hand contact during a date. Trust me, it wasn&#39;t an accident.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women show their interest level if you&#39;re paying close enough attention or if you just know what to look for. Your fl ake rate is greatly diminished if a woman has this level of interest - but never gone completely. You can expect a kis s at the end of the night if you go for it as long as you did everything right on the date, and by &quot;do everything right,&quot; I&#39;m referring to raising her interest on the date. I advise men not to go for the kiss at the end of the first date, but that&#39; s just my preference, as I want the woman wondering if I liked her - unless she just goes for it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;ve had that happen multiple times at the end of a first date. Unless you&#39;re uninterested, never refuse a woman&#39;s kiss if she goes for it first. Women don&#39;t handle rejection very well. I prefer always to ask a woman to come back to my p lace, as it&#39;s a man&#39;s responsibility to create an opportunity for sex. The goal should be to raise a woman&#39;s interest eve</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ry date. In my opinion, if you didn&#39;t raise a woman&#39;s interest on a date, then it was a lost opportunity. The goal shoul d be to raise a woman&#39;s interest to the point where she is comfortable sleeping with you. If you didn&#39;t do that, then y ou&#39;ve wasted your time and money.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A man should never enter a courtship with the mindset of finding a girlfriend or wife. That&#39;s a turnoff to women, as i t&#39;s a sign of desperation. Women can smell when a man is actively seeking a relationship. If a woman entered the dat e with a level of interest of seven, then you should try to get it to an eight by the end of the date. The entire point of going on a date is to raise a woman&#39;s interest and get her more comfortable. Women have to feel comfortable with a man and have a high-enough interest before sex can happen. If you&#39;re a guy who meets a woman you like and you h ope to make her your girl, you&#39;re going to have to raise her interest a little more before she starts thinking about a rel ationship - unless she&#39;s looking for a beta-male provider. You look like you could be a great provider.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The only upside to a woman viewing you as a beta-male provider, if you want to call it that, is that you don&#39;t have to raise her interest. All you have to do is look like you&#39;ll be a great provider if that&#39;s what she&#39;s looking for. If you did a great job of raising her interest throughout the date, then you probably stand a good chance of her coming back to your place. You have to think ahead about the logistics before going on a date. You have to anticipate your ability to raise her interest throughout the date. Confident men always think they can raise a woman&#39;s interest during a date. B ut you may or may not have sex when you get back to your place. A lot of variables come into play when it comes to having sex with a woman for the first time. Is your place clean; do you have roommates who may show up any seco nd; are you good at seduction, breaking down her last-minute resistance, and making her feel comfortable; is she on her menstrual cycle; and so on?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I worked in sales as a trainer for a few years, and I can tell you that most people always have a last-minute objection or resistance, and it&#39;s your responsibility to overcome those objections and bring home the sale. Remember, most wo men will give you one last test before sleeping with you. That test usually comes in the form of testing your patience before sex. You have to let women get comfortable before engaging in sex with you for the first time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Women want men to respect them, so this is an eternal battle that men know nothing about. Men don&#39;t have to worry about their reputations when engaging in sexual activities like women do. If you&#39;re in a relationship and your woma n has an interest level of seven, you might have sex at least once a week. I do understand that sometimes the slowdo wn in the bedroom is due to the man not wanting sex very often because he&#39;s gotten bored sexually. Still, I&#39;m coming from the premise that it&#39;s the woman who&#39;s not really in the mood often - and this is because I&#39;m a male dating coac</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">h. I&#39;m well aware that women get something from my content as well, but my primary audience is men, so keep that in mind when reading this book. If you&#39;re in a relationship, this is the interest level where things are &#39;t all that bad - b ut they aren&#39;t all that great either. Things are floating along without any problems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To be honest, this is where most prolonged, healthy relationships hover. By &quot;healthy,&quot; I&#39;m referring to not hating eac h other. It&#39;s just unrealistic to maintain that passion and intensity for extended periods unless you&#39;re one of the lucky ones who has met your soul mate. This is why we prefer not to get into extended, committed relationships. It&#39;s not th at I&#39;m afraid of getting hurt but rather the thought of just existing in a passionless relationship just for the sake of hav ing someone. Most couples may have fallen in love at some point, but that&#39;s usually downgraded to just love after a f ew months or years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The difference between being in love and just love is that when you&#39;re in love with someone, you&#39;re still highly attra cted to them as a whole. This is not just their physical being; their whole being gets you going inside, mentally, and physically. When you love someone, that means you love them for the person they are, but they don&#39;t do anything fo r you spiritually. This is why a woman can love her male friend but not be in love with him. When you&#39;re in love wit h someone, their validation means everything to you. Couples don&#39;t remain in love all the time but stay together beca use they love each other. That&#39;s common because we all have expectations when we first meet someone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At some point, no matter how long it takes, the real us comes out. This &quot;love&quot; they feel has more of a friendly vibe t han the &quot;in love&quot; passion they once had. This leads to the relationship feeling more like roommates than lovers. The key for men is to change from within genuinely. You can only pretend to be a high-value man for so long. When a man genuinely changes from within, there is no representative. You are the representative. When a man in a relation</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ship is genuinely who he is, and if that&#39;s the guy she fell in love with, then the relationship can&#39;t lose steam because t here won&#39;t be any personality changes coming from the man. That doesn&#39;t mean the woman doesn&#39;t have a representa tive, but I firmly believe that men directly influence female behavior.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When a man is confident and masculine, a woman can&#39;t help but stay feminine as long as her interest was genuine, t o begin with. I know some women are good at concealing their true intentions, but if you read this book, you&#39;ll learn the signs of interest from women.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">An interest level of eight is when you start to become a priority to a woman. This is when you&#39;ll start to see a woman doing some of the pursuing-unless she&#39;s structured. If a woman isn&#39;t structured, she&#39;ll start to pursue to speed things along and progress the relationship. When a woman has this kind of interest, you start to see a very feminine woman</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">. The best way to keep a woman in her feminine energy is to keep her interest level relatively high. When a woman h as an interest in this range, flaking is greatly diminished because there are not a lot of things she&#39;ll have a higher inte rest in.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Expect a lot of physical contacts, like holding hands or sitting overly close. Never pay attention to what a woman sa ys or even does to a certain degree. A woman&#39;s body language is always the best way to gauge her interest. A lot of women know all the right things to say, and some even know all the right things to do, like cooking for you occasion ally or giving you a back massage, but body language never lies. Women generally fake high interest with naive me n who they perceive as beta males.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Women&#39;s body language only displays this level of interest when it is high. She does this to feel your masculinity an d to be reassured that you like her. A woman can only have this level of interest if she&#39;s uncertain of your interest lev el. I wish we lived in a world where we could tell women we loved them every day, but unfortunately, women find t his behavior boring and weak. The reason for that is you come across as uncertain as to where you stand with her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For example, the average person tells you they love you so they can hear it back. When a man does this, it comes acr oss like he wants to make sure the woman says it back because he&#39;s uncertain if the woman still loves him or he wan ts to hear it to make himself feel better about where he stands with the woman. Women can intuitively read through t his insecure behavior, and it&#39;s a turnoff. Anything that comes across as you being insecure starts to kill a woman&#39;s att raction. If you&#39;re in a marriage or monogamous relationship, I&#39;m not saying you should never tell your woman you lo ve her, but it should be done sparingly, as it makes you look insecure. A good rule of thumb that works for me when I used to be in monogamous relationships was only to say &quot;I love you&quot; in response to the woman if she said it first.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now you don&#39;t have to be that stringent, but you get my point. I know women are going to read that line and say that &#39;s a bunch of hogwash. Still, men with any significant amount of experience know that the women had a low interest in always pursue them, but the women had a high interest in fleeing more often than not. This is because when you have low interest in women, you do everything right as far as keeping their interest high because you don&#39;t care that much. Keep in mind that the women you have low interest in will only pursue you if they have a moderate or high in terest in you. If she has low interest and you have low interest, she won&#39;t pursue you either. The point here is always to maintain the masculine frame and never let a woman know where she stands with you. When you get a woman&#39;s i nterest this high, it&#39;s obvious when it has dropped. When women&#39;s interest level drops, you start to see flaky, inconsi stent behavior.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She might start to flake on you, and her sweet, little early morning texts she used to send all of a sudden stop. When you try to set a date, all of a sudden, it&#39;s harder for her to find the time. She always used to try to look sexy for you, b ut now she hardly puts any effort into her appearance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This could be her getting comfortable, but more often than not, it&#39;s the fact that her interest level isn&#39;t where it should be for her to care enough to put in the effort to look her best for you. If you&#39;re in a relationship and you recognize y our woman&#39;s interest level hovering around this point, then you&#39;re in a pretty good place. Understand that women&#39;s i nterest drops over some time, so this isn&#39;t a time to get comfortable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You could be in a good place today and be in a different place in just a couple of months. This is that &quot;trap&quot; interest l</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">evel. This is when a man starts to let his guard down because his woman is usually making it easy for him by her use of limited tests and feminine behavior to the point he starts to lose his masculine frame. When a woman isn&#39;t as coo perative, it&#39;s easier to maintain the masculine frame because you know if you show any weakness, she&#39;ll walk all ove r you, but what if she&#39;s acting feminine?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A lot of men take their foot off the pedal, so to speak, because she&#39;s cooperating. An interest level of nine is when a woman has fallen in love with you. This is when you&#39;ll start to hear those three magic words: &quot;what are we?&quot; OK, in all seriousness, you might hear &quot;I love you&quot; also, but you can all but be assured that a woman wants to be exclusive by this point.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If you&#39;re a guy who&#39;s not ready to settle down just yet, then a good reply would be, &quot;I like to take my time and not ru sh into anything.&quot; This will only buy you a little more time; however, most women are not going to let a man waste t heir time because women know their value to a man is mostly her appearance. Women who are looking to get marrie d to the highest-value male they can attract aren&#39;t going to let a man take most of their prime years and then leave the m when they&#39;ve aged.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re a guy who&#39;s not the relationship type, you have to be cool with losing women from time to time. Some wo men will not let you use them for an extended period. When a woman is at this interest level, pretty much anything s exually you desire she would do, within reason.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re a guy that&#39;s looking for a relationship, then this is what you want to hear. The funny thing about being a ma n who&#39;s looking for a relationship is you usually turn women off when you&#39;re looking for a relationship unless she&#39;s a woman looking for a relationship too.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re a man who&#39;s looking for a relationship and you&#39;re dating a woman who&#39;s casually dating, you&#39;ll probably tur n her off because she&#39;ll be able to sense the relationship vibe you&#39;ll undoubtedly be sending.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In my opinion, it&#39;s better to be a man who&#39;s just enjoying the single life and to let love find you. When you&#39;re activel y seeking love, essentially, you feel incomplete and want a relationship to bring you happiness. In actuality, you sho uld be content being single and have learned how to enjoy your life as a single man. A woman should complement y our life, not be your source of happiness. This is why it&#39;s so important to have a purpose in life. If you&#39;re in a relation ship and your woman has this level of interest, then keep doing what you&#39;re doing, but if you notice a drop in interest</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">, you need to get back to doing what you were doing. It&#39;s easy to tell when a woman has lost interest at this level. Sh e won&#39;t be as enthused to see you as she once was.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You might notice a slight drop in femininity. When women&#39;s interest level starts to drop, you&#39;ll notice a slight increa se in bitchy behavior. You might also notice that all of a sudden, those freaky little things she once did in the bedroo m have now all but gone. Women can only be 100% submissive to a man who&#39;s 100% in his masculine frame. This means you never put her ahead of your purpose and passion in life. The number one reason women start to lose inter est, in my opinion, is men start to put their women on a pedestal. When a woman sees a man who&#39;s head over heels i n love, she loses attraction because she now knows she&#39;s the one leading the relationship. It&#39;s OK for a man to love h is woman, but I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s good when the man falls in love. It&#39;s hard for a man to stand up to his woman once he falls in love. Men always need to have the strength to walk away from a woman. This is virtually impossible to d o once a man falls in love.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This inability to walk away from a relationship is a big turnoff to women. It happens to be the only way to keep a w oman submissive because women tend to cross the line from time to time. An attraction level often is when a woman is attached to you. This is beyond a woman loving you; this is when she thinks about you, 24/7. I don&#39;t believe wom en are capable of loving men for who they are.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If a woman views you as an alpha male, I believe she loves you for how you make her feel, but if she views you as a beta-male provider, she loves you for what you can provide. I believe this because if a woman loved you for you, th en it would be impossible for her to stop loving you. You are the same person. Well, what happened to her love? Th e answer is simple: you don&#39;t make her feel the way you used to.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You probably got comfortable, and the relationship lost its intensity. It&#39;s extremely hard to maintain this attachment because we all tend to get comfortable, and therefore all the sexual tension you used to create by being indifferent, y ou can no longer create since you&#39;ve developed deeper feelings. A woman can only submit or stay submissive to a m an who makes her chase his validation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This is, of course, if a woman perceives you as an alpha. A woman can&#39;t become attached to a man she sees as a beta male. The reason I said &quot;she sees&quot; is that some women might view you as an alpha male, while others view you as a beta male. The only thing a woman is attached to with a beta male is his wallet. If a beta male loses his job and ther efore can&#39;t provide as did before, he&#39;ll lose his woman if he doesn&#39;t get things turned around in a timely fashion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, if a man a woman perceives as alpha-and who she&#39;s attached to-loses his job, the woman would stick it out as long as he made her feel the same way he always did. The problem here is that a lot of men get their alpha qualiti es from their financial situation and not their charisma; therefore, if they lose their jobs, they lose their swagger and confidence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is why it&#39;s important to get your swagger internally rather than from external sources like money. A lot of men can have an abundance mindset if they make a million a year and drive a Mercedes G-Class, but if they lose their inc ome, their confidence and indifference go away immediately. Every man feels better about themselves when they m ake more money, and I&#39;m no different, but your confidence shouldn&#39;t completely come from something you have no control over. You can always lose a couple of contracts or get fired.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The woman became attached to you based on your confidence and the strength you exhibited throughout the relation ship. You always led, and whenever she would test your masculinity by trying to take the lead or troll you to move y ou off-center, you were able to pass with flying colors because you weren&#39;t afraid of losing her because you felt you could replace her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can&#39;t all of a sudden enter a scarcity mindset and fear to lose her. If a woman is with you because she perceives you as a beta male, then you don&#39;t have to worry about confidence; you need to find another job quickly. When a wo man is attached to you, she&#39;ll pursue you 100%. This, coincidentally, is the only way to keep her attached. Expect th at from time to time she&#39;ll complain that you never initiate contact. Just hold firm and say, &quot;I&#39;m so busy I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going or coming most of the time.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She&#39;ll still complain, but you should never initiate contact at this point. She&#39;s chasing your validation, and that gives you the power. This should only be done if your woman is attached. When a woman is chasing, you&#39;re validation. Y ou don&#39;t have to worry about her pulling back. A female pullback happens when she loses attraction, usually because you&#39;re no longer a challenge or mystery to her. It could also be that the relationship has lost sexual tension and has t aken on more of a friendly or roommate vibe. Another reason a woman pulls back is to manipulate you into pursuin g her more strategically; therefore, she has the power in the relationship. The power in a relationship comes from wh oever appears to care less. If you care more about her than she cares about you, then there is no way you could ever make her submissive. A woman is only submissive to a man she fears losing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A woman doesn&#39;t fear to lose a man who loves her more than she loves him. Remember, she doesn&#39;t love you; she lo ves the way you make her feel. The way you make her feel is based on you having a higher value than she does, and that&#39;s why you don&#39;t initiate contact. You&#39;ll feel tempted to pursue her because your conscience will make you feel g uilty about making her do 100% of the pursuing, but this is the best way to keep her chasing your validation. Most m en think women want certainty. Therefore they try to do everything to alleviate this uncertainty when, in actuality, w omen need this turmoil in their lives to maintain their attraction level. Why do you think women pursue the bad boy? The bad boy makes women feel alive. You don&#39;t need to ride a motorcycle and do drugs to give women this feeling. Just stay unpredictable and keep her chasing your validation. I also want to add that this is the highest interest level, and most men will never have a woman with interest this high. A lot of men overestimate a woman&#39;s interest level. I t&#39;s best to underestimate a woman&#39;s interest level; that way, you never become complacent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 05</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">External Things That Lower Your Sexual Market Value</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You must understand that anything that takes money out of your pocket lowers your sexual market value. Another th ing you must understand is that this only pertains to women who view you as a potential beta-male provider. Wome n who view you as an alpha male don&#39;t care if you&#39;re homeless and unemployed. I can vouch from experience that if a woman views you as an alpha male, she won&#39;t mind you lacking in the financial department so long as you maintai n your confidence and sexual intensity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s where the problem lays. Most men who lack financial success, once they start to care about the woman or &quot;cat ch feelings,&quot; let this lack start to create insecurities. I&#39;ve had this happen in the past. Men are taught women love a m an with money, and that&#39;s true, but this doesn&#39;t apply when a woman views you as an alpha male. So what exactly is alpha to women? Well, it&#39;s her perceived sexual market value of a man.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If a woman thinks you have a high sexual market value, she&#39;ll deem you as alpha until proven otherwise. How does a woman determine your sexual market value? She does so based her physical attraction to you, combined with your swagger or apparent confidence. Generally speaking, unless you let yourself go physically, she&#39;s not going to lose at traction. The moment at which women lose interest is when a man loses his confidence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A lack of confidence causes men to act feminine-that is, unsure of himself. Women are very unsure of themselves; t hat&#39;s why they need constant male validation. Just so you know, acting insecure and unsure of yourself is a feminine trait.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This state of insecurity you&#39;re in causes the woman to move into her masculine energy. Once this happens, the relati onship is over. If a woman once viewed you as an alpha male but lost that attraction, she can never get back to that l evel of attraction again. It&#39;s sort of like your woman catching you cheating. She might not break up with you, but the trust is gone; therefore, her guard will forever stay up, causing her to never give herself to you completely again.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The relationship, no matter how long it lasts, will never have that passion it once had because she&#39;ll be forever holdi ng back. The same holds true for when a woman loses that alpha-male level of attraction. She&#39;ll never be completely 100% submissive because she now doubts your masculine core. You&#39;re as insecure as she is; how is she to trust you? Do not confuse confidence with arrogance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A lot of men make the mistake of trying to display confidence, which comes across to others as arrogance. What I&#39;ve learned about arrogant people is that they are usually the most insecure. This is why they must remind you about ho w great they are. They really aren&#39;t trying to convince you, but rather themselves. Confidence is something that&#39;s just displayed- no words need to be spoken. Arrogance is when you verbally let others know of your greatness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Don&#39;t confuse this with trash-talking, as I was the biggest trash-talker in my video game and athletic days. I used to t rash-talk to get inside of the head of my opponent. An arrogant man always crumbles once a woman starts to test. N o matter how confident you seem, women will always test to see if it&#39;s what it seems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you don&#39;t have a car, you have kids from a previous relationship, you live with your mother, and so on, yes, it does lower your sexual market value, but only to women who view you as a potential beta-male provider. The car and liv ing situation are things that you can control, but you can&#39;t get rid of your child. This means that you&#39;ve made yoursel f ineligible for a lot of women , but if you have an abundance mindset, you should know there are a lot of women w ho won&#39;t mind. Even some women who view you as a potential beta- male provider might not even care as long as it doesn&#39;t negate your ability to provide. In other words, if you make $500k a year, a woman won&#39;t think you having on e child will negate your ability to provide. However, if you have 3 kids and make $40k a year, she most certainly wo uld, but who cares about dating women that view them as beta males?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Don&#39;t get me wrong; I see nothing wrong with a man dating women who view him as a beta male, but I am damn sur e not losing any sleep over the ones who don&#39;t want to date me because they don&#39;t think I&#39;m a good-enough provider. I advise men to casually date women who view them as beta-male providers but to never get into a relationship or a dd these women to their rotations.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 06</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some Women Will See You as Alpha, Some Will See You as Beta</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the dating community, there are primarily two categories men are put in. Those two categories are alpha males an d beta males. Everyone wants to be an alpha male, although some men have no trouble telling you they&#39;re a beta mal</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e. How I classify an alpha male is a man who doesn&#39;t need to compensate women financially for their sexual compan ionship or time. Women will sleep with him with no monetary gain. When I say &quot;monetary gain,&quot; I&#39;m referring to gif ts, cash, paying bills, expensive dates, and so on. I classify a beta male as a man who has to compensate women for t heir sexual companionship. If a woman views you as a beta male, but you don&#39;t have anything to provide financially, she&#39;ll just use you for attention and validation. This can be done with phone conversations or meaningless dates. No w here&#39;s the catch: you could have your finances in order even though you are a man she views as a beta male, and s he still won&#39;t want to sleep with you despite her being open to being with a beta- male provider. Why is this? How c ould a woman be open to being with a man she views as a beta male but not want to be with a particular beta male?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here&#39;s a simple example: Let&#39;s say you know that looks and charisma still play a small role in attraction even if the woman views you as a beta-male provider. You must understand that even if you don&#39;t mind being in a relationship with a woman who views you as a beta male, if she has another beta male trying to win her over and both of you ma ke relatively the same amount of money, the deciding factor could come down to who she finds the most attractive. When I&#39;m referring to the &quot;most attractive,&quot; I&#39;m not just talking about looks. I&#39;m talking about the entire sex-appeal p ackage. Some things I&#39;m going to repeat in this book over and over, and that&#39;s so I don&#39;t sound like I&#39;m contradicting myself. I want to make sure I&#39;m clearly distinguishing one point from another. When dealing with women who perce ive you as a beta male, you also need game, because women who are seeking beta-male providers are notorious for l eading on men they view as beta males without ever sleeping with them. This is why it&#39;s important to keep the first f ew dates cheap and cut your losses after three dates. If a woman is seeking a beta-male provider, your financial situa tion is always the most important thing, as long as you meet her minimum attraction level. When I say &quot;attraction,&quot; I&#39; m talking about your sex appeal as a whole. That&#39;s looks, charisma, style, and personality. If a woman views you as a beta-male provider, as long as you meet her minimum attraction level, you don&#39;t have to raise her interest to sleep with her. She&#39;ll sleep with you out of obligation because you&#39;re providing. When I&#39;m talking about women seeking b eta-male providers, I&#39;m talking about women seeking a relationship. Women obviously would prefer to meet a man t hey perceive as an alpha male who can provide. The issue with that notion is that those kinds of men are few and far between. Men who a woman views as alpha males aren&#39;t in short supply, but men who a woman views as alpha male s who can provide and are open to the idea of being in a relationship are. A lot of the men women would view as alp ha males are either in long- term marriages or not open to the idea of being in a relationship. This leads women who are actively seeking relationships to settle for the man she perceives as a beta male. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea for men to actively seek a relationship, but it&#39;s customary for a woman once she&#39;s ready to settle down to openly look fo r a relationship because she knows the clock is ticking. Her greatest asset, her looks, is diminishing every day. No m atter whether woman views you as an alpha male or beta male, most men will have to at least take a woman on one d ate or outing. This is usually because women need to feel comfortable with a man before she can sleep with him. Thi s one date is also when she can figure you out to see whether you truly are as confident as you seem. I think most tes ts women do are largely due to low interest, but I do think women occasionally test to see if you are what you claim you to be. I say &quot;outing&quot; because it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be a date in the sense of a dinner date or something of that nature. It could be something as simple as meeting for a drink. If she perceives you as an alpha male, she won&#39;t need many outings before she wants to sleep with you. Usually one will do, or maybe she needs none depending on her attraction level and her confidence in her sexuality, because a woman technically could&#39;ve tested you when you met her - therefore, she doesn&#39;t need a date to test you. When I say &quot;confidence in her sexuality,&quot; I&#39;m referring to her ability to care less about what anyone else thinks of her sexual reputation. Most women don&#39;t want to be looked at as a whore or slut. Some women, however, in this new gynocentric society, couldn&#39;t care less what any man-or woman for that matter - thinks of them. I remember vividly in my early twenties a woman telling me that she just wanted to sleep with me. I can remember the shock I had, and my facial expression caused her to say, &quot;A woman can sleep aro und just like a man. Why is it bad for me to just want sex, but not you?&quot; This was my first experience with a woman who was completely comfortable with her sexuality, but it wasn&#39;t my last. And remember, a woman perceives you as an alpha male because whether you&#39;re considered an alpha male is totally up to the woman.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some women have been socially programmed to think guys who wear suits or preppy clothing are alpha males. Som e women think that only bad boys- for example, gangbangers or drug dealers-are alpha males. I know this because I grew up in that type of environment, and those women didn&#39;t care about guys making the honor roll; they chased the guys who were in and out of juvenile hall. That fast life was attractive to them.Another reason a woman would perce ive you as alpha is if she sees you garnering a lot of female attention. This is usually due to some sort of social status</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">. This social status could come from being popular, making a lot of money, being an athlete, and so on. This is calle d preselection. In my opinion, there&#39;s nothing that raises a woman&#39;s interest level higher than her seeing other wome n vying for your attention.Last, a woman could perceive you as alpha just based on her attraction level. If a woman f inds you very attractive, then she&#39;ll initially think that every woman must see you the same way. The only thing that can kill this kind of attraction is being insecure. An insecure man signals a man who&#39;s not very good with women. S he then starts to doubt your sexual market value, causing her to test more and more. A woman testing an insecure ma n is like taking candy from a baby. There&#39;s no way an insecure man could ever pass these tests without first developi ng an abundance mindset. I consider myself to be an alpha male, but I&#39;ve dated women who I could tell considered me a beta male. The reason I think they felt this way is that physically, I wasn&#39;t exactly what they liked. Remember, with a woman, you don&#39;t have to be a ten in her eyes to get a date; you just need to be at least a 5 on a scale of one to ten. This low initial interest, however, will make her perceive you as a beta; therefore, you would need several dates to raise her interest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Upon meeting a man, a woman just assumes since you&#39;re not that attractive to her, you must not be that attractive to anyone, but you&#39;ll see a quick change in her interest level if she sees other women vying for your attention. If she not ices other women vying for your attention, then she&#39;ll perceive you as an alpha male unless the women vying for you r attention are only interested in your money or resources. If that&#39;s the case, she might consider you a trick and lose e ven more interest. Women do not respect tricks, or men whose game is so weak they have to buy women things for s exual companionship. Don&#39;t confuse a lack of respect with a lack of appreciation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A woman gladly appreciates a trick, but that doesn&#39;t mean she respects him. I have no problem dating women who p erceive me as a beta male because I&#39;m not looking for a relationship. Women tend to try to string along men they per ceive as beta males much longer, so with this in mind, I advise any man to cut their losses after three or 4 dates-prefe rably after three. I only advise trying a 4th date if you were close on the third date. As a high-value man, you have to value your time and money. I know most men have been socially programmed to think they need to date a woman f or two months before they sleep with her, but I can tell you from experience that same woman who&#39;s making you wa it for sex has probably slept with multiple men on the first date. I know what you&#39;re thinking: is everything about sex</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">? The answer is yes. See, the thing is a lot of women will use you if you let them. This could be for attention-for free dates with no intention of doing anything sexual with you. So you are not only wasting your time and money but als o developing some feelings for her. This means that if you get the &quot;I see you only as a friend&quot; speech, it could leave you in a bad place mentally. She knew she only saw you as a friend initially but enjoyed the attention and free dates you gave her. This isn&#39;t about being afraid of love; this about being smart with your time and money. High-value me n don&#39;t have time to date women who don&#39;t want them sexually.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 07</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Becoming a High-Value Male Doesn&#39;t Make You Immune to Games</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A lot of men seem to have the mindset that once they increase their income and lose some weight, all of a sudden w omen will start throwing themselves at them. This is the furthest thing from the truth. No matter how much money y ou make, women will always play manipulative games. This could be due to a lack of interest or just a woman&#39;s natu rally manipulative ways. Men have to understand that being a high-value man isn&#39;t a state of being but rather a state of mind. In my first book, Alpha Male Strategies: Dating in the Social Media Age, I classified a high-value male as a man with limited time at his disposal. This means that he only has time to engage with women who have a genuine interest. In this book, I&#39;ll go a step further. A high-value man is not only a busy man with limited time at his disposa l but also a man whose mind isn&#39;t preoccupied with women. The point is that, technically, a man could be busy, but t hat doesn&#39;t necessarily mean his mind isn&#39;t on women. You become a truly high-value man not only when you&#39;re not too available but also when your thoughts aren&#39;t consumed with females. You could be busy, but if you&#39;re wondering why that girl from the club never returned your call, then that isn&#39;t exactly acting like a high-value man in my book. A man has to also understand that he isn&#39;t the only high-value man in the world. For some reason, once a man gets a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">better-paying job, he starts to assume that he&#39;s the only man in the world with a high- paying job. The government di dn&#39;t stop printing money once you got a better-paying job. Every day, several other men join the high-value male clu</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">b. Getting your life in order doesn&#39;t make you God&#39;s gift to women. Getting your life in order just makes you a more attractive mate to a larger group of women. Women play games, which is why men get tired and settle down. Men d on&#39;t settle down because they&#39;re tired of the caravan of women coming in and out of their bedroom, but rather becaus e of the endless games that women play.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 08</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why Woman Make Beta Males Wait</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re a man who&#39;s reading this who perceives himself as a beta male, you might&#39;ve noticed it takes more work fro m you to sleep with a woman than it does to pass a law in Congress. Notice the phrase &quot;perceives himself as a beta male.&quot; That&#39;s because if you&#39;re a man who perceives himself as a beta male, it&#39;s just the way you think of yourself. I don&#39;t think there are any true beta males. I believe some guys give up too easily in their pursuit of women. I get rejec ted by women, but it doesn&#39;t deter me from approaching more women (i.e., the abundance mindset). Men who percei ve themselves as beta males get rejected a couple of times, and they just designate themselves beta males who need t o get rich for women to find them attractive (i.e., a scarcity mindset). With that being said, the only difference betwe en a man who perceives himself as an alpha male and one who perceives himself as a beta male is the abundance mi ndset versus the scarcity mindset. You see this in the business world; the alpha male has an abundance mindset and s tarts his own business despite other businesses offering the same services. His abundance mindset allows him to thin k that there&#39;s enough business to go around, while the man who perceives himself as a beta male always thinks that t here are enough businesses offering whatever business he was considering, which means he&#39;s in a mindset of scarcit</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">y. When I started my YouTube channel, there were dozens of dating coaches already on YouTube, but my abundanc e mindset allowed me to think that I could build my own audience. Men who perceive themselves as beta males let o ne rejection lower their confidence, but in actuality, had that same guy kept approached women, he would&#39;ve met wo men who found him attractive. This is mainly because there isn&#39;t a universally good-looking or bad-looking guy in my opinion. I still can vividly remember when the &quot;prison bae&quot; (Jeremy Meeks) phenomenon was going on, some w omen said they didn&#39;t see what all the fuss was about despite a majority of women finding him attractive. I remembe r hearing this from female family members, who said this about Denzel Washington when I was a kid. Some thought Denzel was gorgeous, while others deemed him average at best. I won&#39;t lie to you and act like there isn&#39;t a general g uideline for what beauty is and what it&#39;s not. I understand that the overwhelming majority of people would say Beyo nce is more attractive than Gabourey Sidibe (the woman who played Precious). I won&#39;t play on your intelligence and act like I don&#39;t know there&#39;s a genera l guideline for what&#39;s attractive. My point is, although an overwhelming majori ty of the people proclaim Beyonce more attractive, there&#39;s always going to be some who find Gabourey Sidibe more attractive, no mat t er your opinion. I understand that if you put me up against Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson, I may l ose if you took a poll asking women who&#39;s more attractive. I understand that, but what I also understand is that 111g et some who pick me. The reason I&#39;m pointing this out is it doesn&#39;t matter if your friend or brother attracts more wo men than you. You&#39;re not in a contest. All you should be concerned with is attracting the women who find you attrac tive. So if you&#39;ve relegated yourself to be a beta male, then it&#39;s your fault. With that being said, women make men th ey perceive as beta males wait for sex longer than they do men they perceive as alpha males. There are a few reasons women do this.The first reason is obvious: low attraction level. Notice I didn&#39;t say &quot;low physical attraction.&quot; That&#39;s because looks aren&#39;t the be- all and end-all with women as it is with men for the most part. If the woman is looking f or a beta-male provider or a man she could build with, then she1l still date you because having fun with men she per ceives as alpha males isn&#39;t at the top of her priorities at the moment. Don&#39;t get me wrong; she might have a &quot;playthin g&quot; on the side, but for the most part, she&#39;s looking for something more stable. Understand that a woman&#39;s ultimate go al is to land an all-around alpha male and not just a sexual alpha. An all- around alpha has sex appeal and resources. The issue is that, although she wants to be with you because you&#39;re a man with his stuff together, she still doesn&#39;t fin d you very attractive; therefore, she&#39;ll make you wait because sexually you just don&#39;t do it for her. If it&#39;s the beginnin g stage of the relationship, there&#39;s always a possibility you could raise her interest to the point where she perceives y ou as alpha, but if it&#39;s already a prolonged relationship, there&#39;s a very good chance you&#39;ll never raise her interest to th e point where she views you as an alpha male.Even if the two of you make it to the point of being in a monogamous relationship, she&#39;ll still have sex with you very sparingly. Expect her to have a lot of headaches during the relationshi p at night. You&#39;ll never experience the freaky sex men she perceives as alpha males receive. It takes a higher attracti on level to receive oral sex and things of that nature. If a woman perceives you as a beta, she&#39;ll do the bare minimum</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">. Women won&#39;t do any more than they have to, and without the woman&#39;s fear of loss, don&#39;t expect her to bend over b ackward to please you. The reason a woman views you as a beta male is she doesn&#39;t think you have a lot of viable op tions vying for your attention. This lack of competition causes the woman not to fear losing you, which in tum cause s her to expend minimal effort throughout the relationship in order to keep you. Expect a lot of testing and masculin e energy from your woman throughout the relationship due to her low attraction and respect levels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The low respect level stems from her constantly testing and from you constantly failing due to your scarcity mindset. She&#39;ll get more and more bitchy, until maybe one day she can&#39;t tolerate your weak beta behavior anymore and leave s you because she sees you&#39;ll never have the balls to leave her.Another reason a woman doesn&#39;t want to sleep with a man she perceives as a beta is that most men have been programmed to think that a quality woman doesn&#39;t sleep wit h a man within the first couple of months. The only reason a woman would date a man she perceives as a beta is to o btain a long-term relationship. She knows this won&#39;t happen if the man thinks she&#39;s easy, so she&#39;ll make him wait in t he hope this makes him think she&#39;s a &quot;good girl.&quot; Men who perceive themselves as beta males don&#39;t have a good und erstanding of the female nature and therefore don&#39;t understand the concept of high interest. Just because a man perce ives himself as a beta male doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the woman would also perceive him this way, at least initially. A woman theoretically could find a man very attractive physically and deem him as an alpha male, only to find out h e&#39;s really a beta male after a little conversation. Once a woman finds out a man has a beta mindset, despite having w hat she would consider an alpha-male sex appeal, she knows she must make him wait in order for him to respect her if she&#39;s open to having a relationship with a man she perceives as a beta-male provider. Last, beta males talk too muc</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">h. Men who perceive themselves as betas are always trying to escape that title in their own minds and the public per ception that they&#39;re a beta male. This leads the beta male to openly brag about his sexual escapades in the hopes he&#39;ll score social points with his peers and other women. I want to make something abundantly clear: women like to see you with other beautiful women; they don&#39;t like to hear about it in the form of your bragging. Although women try h ard to screen this kind of man out, sometimes one will slip through the cracks. This minor slip up with the wrong kin d of man could ruin a woman&#39;s reputation. As I&#39;ve stated earlier, some women are comfortable with their sexuality a nd couldn&#39;t care less what anyone thinks, but the overwhelming majority of women still care about public perception</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">. I know you&#39;re thinking to yourself, &quot;I thought you said women don&#39;t sleep with beta males right away?&quot; I would sa y that just proves my theory that there are no universally alpha or beta males. Some women will perceive you as a be ta, while others may perceive you as alpha. This last scenario really only matters to women you interact with your ev eryday life. That could be a classmate, a coworker, a neighbor, and so on. If you&#39;re someone the woman doesn&#39;t see on an everyday basis, she might not care, hence why it&#39;s so easy to sleep with a woman when you&#39;re vacationing out of town or out of the country. I&#39;ve always slept with random women when I went on vacation. This was due to high attraction, as well as the woman being freed from the social pressures of being labeled a slut. A lot of women think o f a man in their neighborhood or job as off-limits, as it&#39;s too risky for them no matter how they perceive him. If you&#39;r e trying to sleep with women you interact with on an everyday basis, and she is open to the idea of dating men she in teracts with every day, the woman would likely just observe how you carry yourself from a distance. If you&#39;re a loud mouth, braggadocio type of guy, don&#39;t expect a lot of women in your everyday life to give you much play. However, if she observes you&#39;re a more laid-back type of individual and stay mostly to yourself, you&#39;ll stand a much better cha nce of attracting her attention. Women who don&#39;t have much to offer outside of the bedroom make men wait because they know sex is the only thing of value they have to offer. Don&#39;t expect a home-cooked meal anytime soon with th ese types of women. These kinds of women who have nothing to offer basically ransom sex for a commitment. You can usually spot these kinds of women on dates that really aren&#39;t that enjoyable intellectually and chemistry-wise.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 09</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Men Love Differently and for Different Reasons Than Women</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most people have heard this saying before but may be unaware of what exactly it means. In a nutshell, men fall in lo ve with a woman&#39;s beauty, and women fall in love with how a man makes her feel emotionally. I&#39;ve had a lot of very nice women to whom I had a mediocre attraction level, and I was never able to fall in love with them. They weren&#39;t ugly by any means and could draw male attention, but they couldn&#39;t bring out that sexual passion from me as did so me of the more attractive women I&#39;ve dated. Keep in mind that looks are subjective, so I&#39;m implying that they weren&#39; t sexy to me. Although some of the more attractive women may not have been as much fun to be with outside of the bedroom, I cared more about them because they were able to keep me sexually stimulated past the first couple of mo nths. Now personality does matter, as I would rather have a woman I considered an eight on a scale of one to ten wh</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">o I had amazing chemistry with as opposed to a woman I considered a ten but couldn&#39;t stand as a person. Keep in mi nd that a woman&#39;s cooperation is largely based on her interest and level of respect for you; in some ways the way yo u carry yourself has a direct effect on how a woman treats you, although you have very little control over her physic al attraction to you. Just understand that although you may be dating a woman who acts like a brat, she won&#39;t act like that with every man she encounters. In other words, she knows who to play with. Most men think they&#39;re in love rig ht now or think they have been in love in the past, but more often than not, they merely loved the woman as a person rather than being in love with her. I don&#39;t think men and women actually love one another. I think men love the &quot;ide a&quot; of being in love or lust for a woman. That simply means an overwhelming majority of men love the thought of ha ving a woman to call their own, or they simply lust for a woman they find highly attractive. Women fall &quot;in love&quot; wi th a man who makes them feel a certain way. A man who a woman perceives as a beta male could never make a wo man feel this way, hence why women could never love men they perceive as beta males. Most men settle because th ey have a scarcity mindset and would rather be with a mediocre woman than continue being single until they find a woman they are highly attracted to. This is called settling. Being with a woman of this caliber does make it easier to pass her test, since your physical attraction is low, but you&#39;ll always have that feeling of something being missing. It&#39; s always easier to remain in your masculine frame when you&#39;re dating a woman you&#39;re not that attracted to, but this i s why there are so many sexless relationships. Most people are with someone just to be with someone and basically i n a relationship with their roommate. Men have to learn how to be alone rather than just settle for a mediocre woma n, and by &quot;mediocre,&quot; I&#39;m referring to what&#39;s attractive to you. I&#39;ll keep repeating that throughout this book because I&#39; m sick and tired of people thinking that there&#39;s a universal beauty. What&#39;s mediocre to one man might be beautiful to another man. The biggest issue I&#39;ve found as a dating coach is this notion that some men consider themselves unattr active or uncharismatic. If I repeat it enough in this book, I hope to drive those thoughts out of the dating communit</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">y. I bet if you were to think back right now about the woman you cared about the most or the woman you would get back together with if given the chance, she would probably be the most beautiful woman you&#39;ve dated who had a tol erable personality. I said &quot;tolerable&quot; because I&#39;ve dated some beautiful women who were mentally unstable. So I wo n&#39;t go as far as to say it&#39;s all looks - that would be unrealistic - but I&#39;m willing to bet that dime you fell head over heel s in love with was nowhere near the quality of that woman you considered a seven on a scale of one to ten who you dated even though she just did it for you sexually.Women, however, fall in love through their ears because it&#39;s more about stimulating their emotions rather than their sex organs. Sex does play a role, but just understand that if you attr act a woman mentally, the sex is automatically better because sex is mostly mental with women. You can get wome n head- over-heels crazy about you sexually without the mental stimulation, but you have a much better chance of pl easing her if you attracted her mentally. When I say &quot;through their ears,&quot; most men think, &quot;OK, I&#39;ll just tell her what she wants to hear.&quot; Unless you&#39;re dating a very young and immature woman, most women are aware of this tactic. A nother thing to consider is that it doesn&#39;t matter if you say nice things to a woman until she has an attachment to you. Men need to learn balance in their dealings with women. The way to do this is with a strong, confident, masculine d emeanor that she can respect but not so over the top that you don&#39;t know how to relax and have a good time. You ca n&#39;t compliment a woman too much to the point you&#39;re compliments mean nothing, but you have to feed her a compli ment from time to time. This should only be done when she&#39;s attached to you. If she&#39;s not attached, then you run the risk of lowering her attraction because you&#39;re giving her too much certainty. Ideally, I only like to compliment a wo man if she&#39;s attached and asking for it. For instance, if she asks something to the effect of &quot;Do you miss me?&quot; then I would reply with &quot;Of course daddy misses you.&quot; You must understand the only reason she is asking you that is you&#39;r e such a mystery to her that she&#39;s trying to get some reassurance. Most guys go overboard with my &quot;no validation&quot; ru le. While you don&#39;t want to give a woman validation initially, once you&#39;ve built the attachment, you have to let her k now you care sometimes. Keep in mind this book is largely about maintaining the attachment and not building the at tachment. Her love will die if she thinks she&#39;s in love with herself. A woman wants a man who&#39;s not obsessed with h er, but she doesn&#39;t want a heartless prick either. There has to be some balance with everything you do in life. The rea son I don&#39;t believe you should compliment a woman until the attachment is built is, quite frankly, that it doesn&#39;t mea n anything to her. A lot of men make the mistake of thinking a woman is going to like them because they constantly tell her, but in actuality the woman couldn&#39;t care less unless she&#39;s feeling the same way. In fact, this could have the o pposite effect since you&#39;re basically being a butt kisser. Women are looking for a king and not a butt-kissing peasant. Constantly complimenting a woman is a sign she&#39;s of higher value than you are and is a big turnoff since she no lon ger has to wonder where she stands with you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 10</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women Know within a Few Seconds of Seeing You Whether They Want to Sleep with You</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If I had a dollar for every time I heard this Chapter &#39;s title growing up, I would be a multimillionaire. I don&#39;t hear it a s much today, but this false statement still permeates the dating world. It should be &quot;Women know within a few seco nds if they would be willing to sleep with you.&quot; The difference in the two statements is the first statement suggests w omen&#39;s decisions are based solely on physical attributes, like men&#39;s decisions for the most part. The latter statement s uggests that while looks aren&#39;t everything to women, you do have to meet a certain level of attraction for women to e ver sleep with you. This goes for men who perceive themselves as beta-male providers. Put in simpler terms, there&#39;s only a very select group of women who would sleep with a man who they have a very low physical attraction to for monetary gain. The overwhelming majority of women must find you somewhat attractive before ever sleeping with you. Keep in mind that looks are subjective, and there is no universal beauty. The latter statement also suggests that although the woman might find you physically attractive, you can still turn her off with your personality. Even if yo u approach a woman who was sending you choosing signals confidently, she still might not like you. The reasons fo r this could be from bad breath, missing teeth, being too corny, being too laid back, not being emotionally available, not being single, and so on.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Really doesn&#39;t matter that the reason is; the only thing that matters is knowing that just because a woman is attracted to you doesn&#39;t mean you have your foot in the door. How many times have you gotten the number of a woman who m you felt had a high interest only to wonder why she is no longer willing to go out even though you know for a fact you were confident throughout the interaction? Compatibility matters to women and is something men rarely consid er when dealing with women. The only scenario when compatibility isn&#39;t a factor is when the woman has a really hig h attraction level but is not looking for anything but casual sex. This is commonly referred to as a &quot;sex buddy.&quot; Thos e women are very rare, however, as women get very little benefit from those kinds of relationships unless they have a man they perceive as a beta male who provides them with validation and dates. In that instance, a woman couldn&#39;t care less about compatibility and cares more about your bedroom skills.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 11 The Experience</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A lot of men want to know the secret to maintain a woman&#39;s interest in the long term. For one, you have to keep dati ng your woman. When a woman is out on a date with her man, this date should feel like what I now call &quot;the experie nce.&quot; &quot;The experience&quot; is not about spending an exuberant amount of money. The experience is more about sexual t ension and seduction. A man has to have a woman when she&#39;s in her feminine energy to seduce her and create sexual tension. You can&#39;t seduce a woman when she&#39;s in her masculine energy. Keeping a woman in her feminine energy is solely based on her interest level at that very moment. Women don&#39;t have a high-interest level in men they perceive as beta males; therefore, men who date women who view them as beta males can never seduce a woman.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The sex is always something that seems more like a deal than a desire. It&#39;s typical for a woman to not willingly sleep with a man she views as a beta male unless he&#39;s continuously providing something. For starters, if you want to sedu ce a woman, make sure your dating women who see you as an alpha male. Remember, every man is perceived as an alpha by somebody. If you are dating women who view you as an alpha male, keep in mind that this isn&#39;t a lifetime a chievement award. Just because she sees you as an alpha today doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s going to view you as an alpha to morrow; it just boils down to her interest level on any given day.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">So first things first: you must make sure her interest level remains high at all times. If you&#39;re curious as to how to do this, check out my first book, Alpha Male Strategies: Dating in the Social Media Age, as I want to keep this book at the advanced level.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now that you have her interest level where it needs to be, you have to put some thought into the date. If you&#39;re a ma n of means, then there&#39;s nothing wrong with expensive dates as long as your finances are in order, but here interest le vel won&#39;t be solely based on how much money you&#39;re spending. I can tell you firsthand that my best dates of seducti on weren&#39;t expensive at all. I won&#39;t go full-cheesy mode with the whole picnic-in-the- park ritual, but I can tell you a nice walk in the park around the lake while periodically stopping to make out on the benches while maintaining a se ductive tone works wonders.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Seduction has a lot to do with your tone (barry white), and when a man is unsure of himself, it&#39;s hard to have the righ t tone. It&#39;s why confidence is the cornerstone of everything dating related. When a man dates a woman who perceive s him as a beta male, it&#39;s virtually impossible to have the right tone because a man who dates a woman who perceive s him as a beta is always unsure of himself due to the lack of affection for the woman gives him. A woman&#39;s interest level in a man has a direct effect on the man&#39;s confidence level when dealing with that particular woman. When a ma n senses a high level of interest from a woman, he naturally acts more confident.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When a woman doesn&#39;t have this interest level, he naturally acts more insecure. So what&#39;s the solution? The solution is to have an abundance mindset and never settle for women who view you as a beta-male provider. I&#39;ve dated sever al women who I could tell viewed me as a beta- male provider. The key is never to put these kinds of women in your rotation and, most definitely to never get into a monogamous relationship with one. I just date them, and once the c ourtship has run its course, I keep it moving, as it&#39;s virtually impossible to raise every woman&#39;s level of interest to th e point at which she views you as an alpha male.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You&#39;ll be able to raise some women&#39;s interest to that level, but not all. Like I&#39;ve said before, just compatibility-wise, i t&#39;s impossible to raise every woman&#39;s interest level that high, as there &#39;s a lot of variables in play. Looks, charisma, at tributes; therefore, you won&#39;t be able to connect with some women on all levels. In other words, no matter what you do, you just don&#39;t do it for these women, so to speak. The problem is some men decide to get into relationships with t hese kinds of women, and the woman goes along with it because he could be a great provider, but the relationship w ill never have the passion that woman needs. When you&#39;re dating a woman and make the dates feel like an experienc e, you never have to worry about her losing interest. She1l be counting down the hours until she sees you again. This should be your goal whenever you&#39;re out with your girl or one of the women in your rotation. If you&#39;re wondering w hat the woman has to contribute to this experience, just keep in mind that she has a personality, and sex appeal is all subjective job to do also. If you&#39;re a high-value man with other options, then it&#39;s her responsibility to make you want to keep asking her out.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So a woman&#39;s top priority is to be cooperative and feminine. When the woman is in the right energy, the man can tak e it from there, as a feminine woman is an easy woman to date. However, if she&#39;s acting masculine and bitchy, you&#39;r e less likely to want to see her again. A woman can&#39;t fake her interest. She can try, but her body language always rev eals the truth. A lot of her feminine energy has to do with how you&#39;re coming across, but some women get their mas culine energy from outside sources, like work, friends, family, and associates. If you&#39;re dealing with a woman who d oesn&#39;t know how to disassociate herself from outside forces when she&#39;s hanging with you, it might not be a good fit. We all have other things going on outside o4 dating lives, but it&#39;s not your responsibility to have to deal with that an d vice versa.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 12</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Only Way to Gain a Woman&#39;s Respect</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the biggest issues in a struggling relationship is usually the lack of respect the woman has for the man, beside s the man dating women who perceive him to be a beta male, to begin with. A lot of men don&#39;t understand how to m ake women submit or get women to respect them, so they resort to yelling and arguing with women. This only leads women to lose even more respect for them because these men are acting like women at that point. I know a lot of me n don&#39;t want to hear this because most men live in a state of scarcity, but to gain a woman&#39;s utmost respect, you have to be willing to break up with her to gain that respect.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The funny thing is, a lot of women want you to break up with them. Women can&#39;t maintain attraction without this fe eling of strength on your part. Don&#39;t confuse a woman staying with you as an indicator of interest. When a woman is truly ready to leave a relationship, she1l usually try to push the man away by becoming an intolerable brat. She1l na g about any little thing in the hope the man will get tired of her. Unfortunately, most women still end up having to d o the breaking up because some men have such a scarcity mindset; there&#39;s nothing the woman could do to push them away.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once it gets this bad, it means her attraction level is so low that regaining her respect and love is out of the question. Without respect, there will be no love. That brings me to another point about being in a relationship with a woman w</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ho views you as a beta male: women don&#39;t respect men they perceive as beta males. I&#39;ve never seen a woman be sub missive to a man she perceives as a beta male. Whenever he suggests something that doesn&#39;t align with what she wa nts, she&#39;ll usually complain, and the man will usually comply. Women don&#39;t act like that with men they perceive as a lpha males. They may test with the occasional pushback subconsciously to see if he&#39;s maintaining his alpha state, but by and large, they follow his program out of respect. If he&#39;s a man she perceives as alpha, she knows it&#39;s pointless a nyway, as he never caves. This doesn&#39;t mean women can&#39;t have an opinion, but don&#39;t confuse having an opinion with not following your leadership. When the subject of which restaurant the two of you should go to comes up, she can voice her opinion, but ultimately, it&#39;s you who decides.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When a woman is with a man who she perceives as a beta, this usually gets him the silent treatment and the cold sho ulder for the rest of the night. This is because women know how easily men they perceive as beta males can be mani pulated, which is why women don&#39;t respect these men, to begin with. If a woman has become unbearable, the best th ing you can do is save the little dignity you have left and break it off. At this point, it&#39;s not even about gaining her re spect but rather maintaining your sanity, as some women become flat-out witches. You can prevent it from getting t hat wrong by only ending things long before she becomes the world&#39;s biggest brat. Once you&#39;ve noticed, you&#39;re a wo man not responding to your feedback about her bad behavior, and you break things off.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Despite what counselors may tell you, talks and lectures don&#39;t work with women anyway. Women always respond to actions better than they do to words. If me saying this frightens you, then you know why you&#39;re having issues with your woman&#39;s bad behavior. When you break things off, you have to have to be prepared to never hear from her agai</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">n. You have to be cool with that. If she was a brat so you would end things, then it&#39;s highly likely you&#39;ll never hear fr om her again. However, if you showed the ability to walk away before her attraction got too low, then it&#39;s highly like ly you&#39;ll hear from her back. Understand that you don&#39;t break up or leave a woman with the intention of raising her i nterest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You leave her because you enjoy your alone time more than you appreciate her. If she reaches back out to you, you s hould inform her that you didn&#39;t like her attitude at the end of the relationship and ask her how&#39;s she willing to make it up to you. This could be anything you want: sex, cleaning, cooking, and so on. It doesn&#39;t matter what it is, as long as she is doing something.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The reason for this is you don&#39;t want a woman to feel like she can just come in and out of your life whenever she wa nts. Maybe the reason for her behavior at the end of the relationship had nothing to do with you. Maybe it was rather due to her having eyes for a new male coworker, so she wanted to date him and see where things could go, or mayb e she was dating him toward the end of your relationship, so she became an intolerable brat toward you- who knows</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All I do know is that it sets a bad precedent if you take her back. It says to her, &quot;Hey, anytime you want a break from me to date other guys, just become a brat again, and when you&#39;re tired of that, you can always just come back home where I&#39;ll be waiting with open arms.&quot; It also sends the message that you&#39;re not just happy to have her back. Under n o circumstances are you to contact her first, or you will live to regret it. You&#39;ll be emasculated every chance she gets. She probably doesn&#39;t even want you back, but figures she&#39;ll get a sick thrill out of emasculating you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Messaging her first won&#39;t raise your sexual market value in her eyes, as you&#39;re acting like a man who couldn&#39;t do bett er. Imagine having an employee who worked for you but quit to find a better job, only to have them come back to yo u for a job. Would you give them a raise? No! You might even offer them less than they were making previously. Th at&#39;s pretty much what&#39;s going to happen to her respect level for you; it&#39;ll decrease.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 13</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why Choosing Signals Is for Advanced Men Only</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When someone thinks of Alpha Male Strategies, the first things they think of are the masculine frame, purpose, offer ing no validation, and waiting for choosing signals. While most individuals understand my concept of holding a mas culine frame, having your purpose, and offering no validation, most individuals misunderstand my concept of waitin g for choosing signals.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I want to clear up any misconceptions anyone might have as far as my philosophy with choosing signals is concerne</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">d. Waiting for choosing signals is not about attracting the most women. On the contrary, cold approaching women is a far better way to get more women&#39;s numbers. Anybody with half a brain can understand that a man who randomly approaches multiple women a day is going to attract more women than a man who doesn&#39;t. Choosing signals is abou t not basing your life around women and sex 24/7.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Most men are in such a thirsty state that they can&#39;t even go out with friends and enjoy their friends&#39; company without obsessing over women. The funny thing is, we live in a society where most men claim to have gone their way, yet t hey can&#39;t even go out and enjoy themselves without women being the focal point of the evening. When you go to a c lub, you see women out just enjoying their girlfriends&#39; company.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Now I want you to look at the men in the same club; what are all of them doing? Most of the men will be looking at and obsessing over the women. Choosing signals is about being able to go on vacation and not needing a female co mpany to enjoy yourself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Choosing signals is not anti-cold approaching women or going into monk mode; choosing signals is about not lettin g your little head control your life 24/7. If you leave the house with the idea of going to the mall to buy a shirt but ju st so happen to see a woman you find attractive, then, by all means, go ahead and cold approach. I don&#39;t want you to leave the house with the mindset of getting as many numbers as possible that particular day. If you leave the house with that mindset, you&#39;ll always be in a state of frustration because your life is based on female validation. Telling m en to never cold approach would contradict everything I teach because I firmly believe a woman&#39;s attraction to a ma n isn&#39;t fully just physical but rather to our other attributes as well. So a woman who views you as a five or six on a sc ale of one to ten might not necessarily send choosing signals despite her finding you somewhat attractive.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although her physical attraction is low, there&#39;s a probability you could raise her interest level with your personality. Telling men to only wait for choosing signals would be implying that men should stay away unless a woman has a h igh physical attraction.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re a novice or beginner with no purpose in life and no women, then waiting for choosing signals is obviously not your best option. Novice or not, I still advise not leaving the house with the mindset of seeking you to look at the men in the same club; what are all of them doing? Most of the men will be looking at and obsessing over the wome</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">n. Choosing signals is about being able to go on vacation and not needing a female company to enjoy yourself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In this instance, if you never get choosing signals, I advise you to look at improving your appearance, which is direc tly correlated to your confidence. This improved confidence is what gives you a swagger. Swagger is how you confi dently carry yourself. It is a much better solution as opposed to spending all your time talking to women, hoping to g et lucky. If you&#39;re a beginner and you&#39;re deciding to go to the club, go with the mindset that you&#39;re going to enjoy yo urself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When I&#39;m referencing is a beginner, I&#39;m referring to not being very good with women or being a virgin. Age doesn&#39;t dictate whether you&#39;re a beginner, as some teenage men have more success than older men do. If you&#39;re out and just so happen to see a woman who may not necessarily see you, then go ahead and approach as long as it is a spur-of-th e-moment thing and not a preplanned notion you had when you left the house. Waiting for choosing signals, 100% o f the time is for advanced, high-value men. Once you become a truly high-value man, you don&#39;t have time to date a woman with low physical attraction, because even though you could easily raise her interest level, throughout a coup le of dates, you don&#39; t have the time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Truly high-value men have the luxury of waiting for choosing signals 100% of the time because they usually already have women in their rotation and packed business life. I&#39;m not about to discard an evening with a woman in my rota tion with a high attraction to date a woman with lukewarm attraction at best. I can remember back in high school wh en I had the opportunity to play basketball, and I didn&#39;t want to play and practice due to my insatiable appetite to pur sue women. Most men make money, but rather than investing the money, and they buy liabilities-you guessed it-to i mpress women.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A man&#39;s life can&#39;t be geared toward him getting laid 24/7. When you base your happiness on how many numbers you &#39;re getting or how many women you&#39;re sleeping with, you&#39;re always going to be depressed because no matter how m any women you sleep with, no number is ever enough. When you base your happiness on pursuing your purpose and the kinds of hobbies you enjoy, your life will be so much happier. Let the women come to you and do the activities you like to do. Most men are miserable because they do activities that they don&#39;t even enjoy for the sole purpose of meeting more women. Is why you see some men in the club who look like they want to commit suicide; it&#39;s because they don&#39;t even like clubs, but they figure, &quot;Hey, a lot of women are going to be here, so why not?&quot; I&#39;m not against th e cold approach as long as it&#39;s organic.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">By &quot;organic,&quot; I mean, for example, let&#39;s assume you&#39;re going to the supermarket to get some barbecue sauce, and yo u just so happen to see a woman you find attractive; by all means, go ahead and cold approach. What I am against is leaving the house to go to the mall for the sole purpose of meeting women. However, if you went to the mall to get t he new Jordans that just came out, and you just so happen to see a beautiful woman in the food court, then, by all me ans, go ahead and approach. It&#39;s all a matter of perspective.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now in a social setting like a club, I still wholeheartedly believe waiting for choosing signals is the best way to go. That&#39;s because, in a social setting, a woman has plenty of time to observe you, and if she wants you, she&#39;ll let you kn ow passively by flirting. While I think in a social setting, this is the best way,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;m not, however, completely against cold approaching as long as your intention when you left home was just to enjo y the event and not get numbers. I wouldn&#39;t do it, but I can understand if you wanted to do it. The reason I wouldn&#39;t do it has nothing to do with fear of rejection but rather the fact that it shows me she either has a low interest or is not available. The lower interest is the more important point because it lets me know that physically, I&#39;m not her cup of tea. As I said previously, looks are not the be-all and end-all with women, so I&#39;m well aware I could raise her interest in my personality and charm, but when you become a truly high-value man, you don&#39;t have time to raise women&#39;s in terest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If you&#39;re not a truly high- value man or working to become a high-value man with limited time at your disposal, you won&#39;t ever understand all of my concepts. Most of my concepts are based on being a high-value man. I know what y ou&#39;re thinking: if you don&#39;t have time to raise a woman&#39;s interest, why not just use a direct approach? Well, besides t he direct approach just seeming highly inappropriate to me, I believe a woman will send choosing signals if she sees you as a seven, and definitely, if she views you as an eight.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That being said, I think a direct approach only works if a woman views you as a nine or a ten. I&#39;m just opposed to rai sing a woman&#39;s interest from a five or six because you&#39;re so low on her priorities that there&#39;s a fifty-fifty chance that you&#39;ll ever get her to go on a date, to begin with. If a woman views me as a seven and is sending choosing signals, th en I know if I do everything I am supposed to on the date, I&#39;m good.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 14</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How to Attract Women with a Busy Schedule</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you become a high-value man with limited time, one thing becomes apparently clear very quickly: you don&#39;t h ave as much time to go out with and meet women. While this is ideal for building yourself up and becoming a high- value man, it doesn&#39;t do much for your sex life. If you&#39;re a very busy man, one of the easiest ways to meet women is online dating. I can see you rolling your eyes at me as you read that statement, but hear me out. Online dating in itsel f is not the problem; the problem is that men let online dating become their sole way of meeting women. Men tend t o walk right past an attractive woman on the street even if she&#39;s sending choosing signals, only to come home and re spond to women online who only want online attention. In a way, online dating enables men, since it&#39;s much easier a nd less risky than approaching women in public.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Online dating should be a tool but not your entire game plan for meeting women. When I use online dating, I only re spond to women who have flirted with me online first and who I find attractive. This is kind of like waiting for choo sing signals online. Once you become a high-value man, you don&#39;t have time to surf through hundreds of profiles an</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ymore. That&#39;s a waste of time anyway, as a lot of the more attractive women from my standards who are online are e ither bots, only want validation, or get swamped by so many men they can&#39;t keep their names straight.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The next way you could meet women is by doing activities you actually enjoy. Listen, I&#39;m all for men busting their b ehinds to accomplish their goals, but with that being said, you have to balance this with everything you do in life. W hat works for me is to bust my behind Monday through Thursday the entire day and then work minimally on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. That allows me to go out Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings and enjoy myself.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When I&#39;m really grinding, it can be Monday throughFriday working and enjoying myself on the weekends after doin g only minimal work in the mornings. Now thats what works for me, but maybe working Monday through Friday th e entire day and taking the entire weekend of works better for you. That&#39;s something you have to figure out. With tha t being said, it doesn&#39;t really matter how you organize your time, but just make sure whenever you do decide to enjo y yourself, you&#39;re doing something you actually enjoy rather than something that you think gives you a better chance of meeting women. If you enjoy shooting basketball in your spare time, I would be the first person to tell you it&#39;s hi ghly unlikely you&#39;re going to meet women shooting basketball, but you&#39;ll have more fun shooting basketball than goi ng to a club or social event if those things aren&#39;t something you enjoy. Another thing to consider is maybe you don&#39;t meet women shooting basketball, but rather you meet the woman of your dreams at the gas station on your way to sh oot basketball. What&#39;s going to happen when you engage in activities you don&#39;t enjoy for the sake of meeting women is you&#39;re going to start pressing - you try so hard to meet women so you no longer have to go to that club or activity anymore because you don&#39;t actually enjoy the club scene or whatever activity you decided to do in the hope of meeti ng women. Now you probably won&#39;t meet women mountain biking, but maybe you meet the woman of your dreams on your way to the mountain. This is called the law of attraction, and I&#39;m a big proponent of it. On top of that, you n ow have hobbies in addition to your purpose, which keeps you in an abundance mindset. To maintain your abundanc e mindset, you have to have hobbies on top of your purpose to relieve stress. You&#39;re now a complete high-value man who doesn&#39;t just depend on his purpose to occupy his time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last, men have to stop thinking they have to be dressed up to approach women. Listen, fellas; the best women you&#39;ll ever meet won&#39;t be at social gatherings, as most women go out to enjoy their friends&#39; company or just to enjoy valida tion from men. A lot of women go out with their guard up, as they anticipate thirsty men approaching them all night. You stand a better chance of attracting a woman at the bus stop or grocery store when you&#39;re just going about your l ife. It&#39;s more organic and natural that way. Her guard is probably going to be down since she wasn&#39;t anticipating getti ng approached in the grocery store. Women are also humbler when they aren&#39;t dolled up with their sexy clothes and makeup on. As a high-value man, you have to learn to live your life on your terms and let the women come to you.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This means pursuing your purpose, enjoying your hobbies, and meeting women organically along the way.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Chapter 15</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Still Getting Tested with a Masculine Frame</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">One thing that keeps coming up is that guys are surprised that, despite holding a masculine frame, their girl-or just p eople in general-still tests them. For the record, while holding a masculine frame does negate a lot of testing from ot hers, it won&#39;t stop it 100%. You just have to understand that there are individuals who will naturally test more than o thers do. Some people just have the bully mentality. They actively seek out people who won&#39;t stand up for themselve</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">s. If you&#39;ve had more than one relationship in your life, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed the difference in how some women t est more than others do. A woman testing you directly correlates to her attraction level to you at any given moment. Just like a shark, if they smell blood, they attack. The same holds true for men. Some men are always in this childish bully mindset, and unless you stand up to them, they&#39;ll only get worse. The thing is, there&#39;s a time to check them, an d there&#39;s a time to ignore them. The same holds true for your woman. There&#39;s a difference between disrespect and tro lling. If someone disrespects you, you have to check them. If a woman flat-out disrespects you, I suggest ending thin gs right then and there. This is because women don&#39;t just disrespect you out of nowhere. It&#39;s a gradual buildup. You&#39;v e been acting weak for a very long time, and now it has come to the point when she just flat-out disrespects you. Exa mples of flat- out disrespect are flirting in your face, staying out all night (if you live together), or just disappearing f or a couple of hours after work when you can&#39;t get in contact with her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Frankly, a pullback isn&#39;t good enough if a woman disrespects you, because she&#39;ll get physical before long. You give some people an inch, and they&#39;ll take a mile. No man should ever hit a woman even if she hits him first, so to preven</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">t being put in this predicament, I advise you to leave the relationship once you notice any disrespectful behavior. Do n&#39;t confuse insecurities and jealousy with disrespect. You getting upset because your girl came home one minute late r than she did the day before is insecurity on your part and not disrespect on hers. Your woman wanting to hang out with her girls for a friend&#39;s birthday is not her disrespecting you. If you feel insecure about things like that, then you&#39; re actually displaying to her that she&#39;s of higher value than you are, which causes her to loose attraction since wome n want men they can look up to. Women can&#39;t submit to men they perceive as having a lower value than they have. A woman trolling you could be something as simple as her mocking your bald spot, your three-minute sex sessions, or your lack of house-cleaning ability. If you notice this kind of trolling, then it&#39;s best to smile and keep moving or m ake a lighthearted joke in response. Under no circumstances are you to get angry and respond angrily. That&#39;s a sign o f insecurity and only invites more trolling, or - even worse - she loses attraction. If you decide to respond with a ligh thearted response, it should be done with a smile and with no malice intended.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I believe in trolling back, but if you-want to laugh it off and turn the other cheek, then you can do that also. Relation ships aside, if another man disrespects you, you should always check him. In my experience, men have a propensity to take your nonresponse as weakness. The average man doesn&#39;t walk-around testing other men, but there are some g uys who are just naturally not good people and always looking for someone weaker to push around. The funny thing is, most of them are all talk, and if you stand up to them, more often than not they&#39;ll back down. Only cowards walk around looking for weaker individuals to bully.As you might be aware of, most cowards always back down when a confrontation is unfolding.Trolling, however, should be ignored, or you can troll back. The reason for this is there is n&#39;t any ill intent involved. They may even want to be friends with you. You can&#39;t expect to make friends if you&#39;re so i nsecure and sensitive that no one can even have a laugh with you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 16</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How to Tell If a Woman Views You as a Beta Male</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some guys aren&#39;t sure how their woman views them in the relationship. There is one surefire way to tell if your wom an views you as an alpha male or as a beta male. When a woman views you as an alpha male, she will initiate sex qu ite often due to her attraction to you. This attraction could be anything from your physical appearance, to sex appeal, to charisma, to strength. When I mention &quot;strength,&quot; I&#39;m not referring to physical strength; I&#39;m referring to your men tal strength - in other words, your abundance mindset. A man with an abundance mindset can always check his wom an when she tests his strength because of his abundance mindset. Sex appeal can be considered a combination of phy sical appearance, charisma, strength, and swagger. When a woman perceives you as an alpha male, she&#39;ll naturally w ant to replicate your genes by way of sexual intercourse.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When a woman views you as a beta male, you&#39;ll be the one having to initiate sex more often than not, if not all the ti me. This is due to the woman&#39;s low attraction level. When a woman views a man as a beta male, sex is more of an o bligation than something she enjoys. I believe no man should get into a long-term, monogamous relationship with a woman who views him as a beta male. Remember, there are no universally alpha males; somewhere there is a woma n who views you as an alpha male and desires you sexually. The problem is that most men settle due to their scarcity mindset. If you&#39;re engaged in a long-term relationship with a woman who views you as a beta male, you&#39;ll never get to experience true love from your partner. Although I don&#39;t believe women love alpha men for themselves, but rathe r the way the men make them feel, it&#39;s still awesome to have a woman who hangs on to your every word as if you&#39;re the air in her lungs. When you date women who view you as a beta male, you&#39;ll never get to experience that, because women only love men they perceive as beta males for what they can provide as a beta male. This could be financial security, attention, relationship stability, certainty, and so on. If you&#39;ve ever been with a woman who viewed you as an alpha male versus a woman who viewed you as a beta male, surely you could tell the difference.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 17</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why Do Women Settle for Beta Males?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A lot of talk about women settling for beta males is centered around financial stability. While this may be true, I can make an argument that it&#39;s not the biggest reason. In my estimation, I think this lies with women actually maturing a nd wanting to start a family. At some point-for men and women-the game gets old. While most men already know th at women enjoy their teenage years and early twenties with the bad boys, women usually gravitate toward the more s</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">table guys-that is, men they perceive as beta males when they mature past that early stage. While the bad boy might have been fun in her early twenties, he&#39;s now considered an immature boy who won&#39;t grow up or commit-a liability of sorts. Ideally a woman would like to meet a man she perceives as an alpha male who&#39;s stable financially, and lega lly of course, and who has an abundance mindset to check her, but this guy is extremely rare because even if she doe s find a man she perceives as an alpha male with all those attributes, he still has to be willing to settle down with her. See, that kind of alpha male usually has a lot of women throwing themselves at him, thus causing him to rarely wan t to settle down. This puts the woman in a conundrum: she can either keep waiting for a man she perceives as an alp ha male to settle down or lower her standards in terms of her attraction level and settle for a man she perceives as a b eta male. Although I&#39;m cognizant of the conundrum the female is in, I still don&#39;t advise any man to get into a relation ship with a woman who views him as a beta male. Only get into relationships with women who have high interest - t hat is, women who view you as an alpha male.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 18</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Men with Nothing Attract Women</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One thing that leaves a lot of men baffled is how men with nothing can seemingly attract beautiful women more easi ly than they can despite the fact that they have more financial success. Well, you must understand that although it m ay appear easier, this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that it was easier. It could be something as simple as this man approa ching more women than you did and playing the numbers game. If I&#39;m shooting basketball and take a hundred shots at the goal, I&#39;m surely going to get more baskets than the guy who only shot twice. While this may be effective in sle eping with more women, I still advise men to wait for choosing signals because my life doesn&#39;t revolve around sleep ing with a million women. My life revolves around pursuing my passion and engaging in hobbies that I enjoy. In life you get what you put into it. The reason a lot of men aren&#39;t where they want to be financially is the same reason the y attract more women than you do. Their life revolves around attracting as many women as possible. When I was a l owly paid security guard, I slept with a lot more women than I do now even though I make twenty times the pay. Th e reason for this is I simply put forth more energy toward sleeping with women than I did toward pursuing my purpo se.Coincidentally, this is why I struggled financially for the majority of my life. You have to understand that your fi nancial situation only matters to a woman once she&#39;s ready to settle down and start a family. When a woman is in the alpha-seeker stage, she doesn&#39;t care about your financial situation unless she just wants to use you. If you&#39;re wonderi ng how to spot these women, it&#39;s easy. If a woman wants to use you for your resources, she&#39;ll be open to going on da tes with you if it&#39;s somewhere nice but will play coy when it&#39;s time to show affection. If a woman wants to use you f or attention, then she&#39;ll have all the time in the world to talk on the phone or text all day but always manages to have an excuse as to why she doesn&#39;t have time to go on a date. If she does go on a date, don&#39;t be surprised if she openly t alks about other men who she&#39;s interested in. That&#39;s just her way of letting you know the two of you are platonic frie nds.When they&#39;re broke and don&#39;t have much to offer in the way of finances, some men naturally increase their sexu al charisma. However, some men lose all their swagger if they&#39;re not successful with their finances. Everybody is dif ferent. I for one lose a little swagger and confidence if my body fat gets too high. My financial situation has never in fluenced my confidence level. I guess you could say I&#39;ve naturally never wanted to be liked for my money. Don&#39;t get me wrong; I like nice things, and if that attracts women, then fine, but I don&#39;t openly set out to attract women with my money. When I first started making money as a personal trainer in the city, I went out and purchased a nice vehi cle. For the first time in my life, I tried to rely on my possessions rather than my personality. I quickly learned that le ading with your wallet is a bad idea, as most women were turned off by me talking about my success. I quickly learn ed it was better to let my financial success be discovered than to openly discuss it. Some guys never lose swagger no matter what they do, but unfortunately every man isn&#39;t like that. Think of it like this: if you lose your sight, it&#39;s said t hat your other senses increase for survival. However, your other senses didn&#39;t really increase; they were always there</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">, but you now are really using them since you have to for survival. This is why when men are incarcerated, they turn into poets, and that&#39;s for survival. A man who&#39;s broke can&#39;t rely on his success to get him in with women.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Financial success can, in some situations, keep you from optimizing your sexual charisma. A man who&#39;s financially successful may have a propensity to rely too heavily on his financial success rather than his sexual charm. The bigge st issue I have with other dating coaches is that just because they never lose confidence with women, they expect eve ry man to have that same ability. This is simply not the case. It&#39;s a proven fact that more masculine men produce mor epheromones, which makes you more attractive to women. Now I&#39;m not saying every broke man produces more phe romones than successful men do, but some do. This is why the no-fap movement had such a huge following. I&#39;m not</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">here to debate whether not fapping increases pheromones, but what no one can debate is the fact that women are dra wn to more masculine men.The bad-boy effect is a real thing. Men who obey all the laws and never get into trouble don&#39;t understand women&#39;s fascination with the bad boy. The bad boy offers women an opportunity to escape their bo ring, monotonous lives and brings some excitement into them. Guys are rational, and therefore they don&#39;t understand that women are emotional and that consistency is unattractive to women. Women are small, frail creatures and since the beginning of time have always sought protection from big, strong men who offered it. Well, it just so happens th at the bad boy offers most women this protective blanket they value so much. This is why it&#39;s so important to always stand your ground when a man tries to disrespect you in front of your girl. You don&#39;t stand a chance with her if she doesn&#39;t feel safe with you anymore. Any man who&#39;s ever had to stand up for their woman can attest to how much it t urns them on.A lot of men spend so much time trying to increase their financial success that they don&#39;t consider how important sex appeal is. Sex appeal is a combination of physical appearance, charisma, and confidence. A lot of bro ke men might lack the resources they would like to have, but don&#39;t have a shortage of sex appeal. Sex appeal is subje ctive, as looks and charisma are both subjective, meaning that every woman has a different taste as far as what&#39;s attra ctive and what&#39;s charismatic. What one woman may take as charisma may not be charisma to another woman.Huma n beings have a herd mentality. You see this with a club or restaurant that everyone is raging about. You want to fin d out what the fuss is all about. You see this with television also; if you hear a show is popular, you&#39;ll be more inclin ed to give it a try. This is the same situation as when a man has a reputation as a ladies&#39; man or is just popular with th e ladies. Women just naturally want to know what is so good about this man. I&#39;ve always said that a man&#39;s sexual ma rket value isn&#39;t decided by how much money he has or how attractive he is but rather by how many high-quality, attr active women he can attract. This is called preselection, and it&#39;s why when you&#39;re single, nobody pays any attention t o you, but the second you get a girl, it seems like every woman in town wants to sleep with you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 19 Charisma</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From my general observations, I&#39;ve noticed there are three different categories of charisma: You have sexual charis ma, which is the kind of charisma that makes an individual a ladies man. This is the smooth-talking individual who c an charm the panties off any woman if he meets her minimum attraction level. There is no universally charming man</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">. What one woman finds charming another might not. I think Kevin Hart is funny; you may not. That&#39;s because there isn&#39;t a universally funny person. It all boils down to taste. I think Steve Harvey is funny; you may not. I love Game of Thrones; you may not.There&#39;s nothing in this world that&#39;s liked by everyone. Some women love the charisma of a laid-back, smooth-talking man, while others prefer the joking, jovial type. So which one is more effective in attractin g women? The answer is simple: whichever man lives more of a social life. You can be as smooth as Billy Dee Willi ams, but if you&#39;re going to live like a hermit, a lot of good it&#39;s going to do you. Men have to find the perfect balance between pursuing their purpose in life and having a social life. In my opinion, charisma, or lack thereof, isn&#39;t most m en&#39;s problem; the problem with most men is that they are lazy and spend more time in their man cave rather than gett ing out and socializing. As the old saying goes, &quot;No one is going to come knock on your door looking for you.&quot; As we age, we tend to live more and more on the inside. When we&#39;re young, we couldn&#39;t sit still for ten minutes, but as we age, the couch and a good football game become more and more satisfying. You have to force yourself out of the house on a regular basis if you want to have success with women. Just don&#39;t lose focus on your purpose in life- bala nce is key.The next category of charisma is entertainment charisma.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This would be the individual whose charisma has built them a large following because people like their personality. Take me, for instance; I have a large following via social media mainly due to my personality. There are tons of dati ng coaches on YouTube, but none get the views I get. The biggest reason for this is I&#39;m just more likable than a lot o f the other dating coaches. Dating- philosophy-wise, there are a lot of good dating coaches on YouTube, but they&#39;re boring. This is what&#39;s called the &quot;it&quot; factor. Now my personality on YouTube is a gift, and while I believe you can in crease your charisma and confidence through self-improvement, by and large there&#39;s only so much you can do to im prove your charisma. Look at it this way; you can only get so strong, you can only get so fast, and you can only get s o much charisma. Our genetics cap everything we do in life. You can study as much as you want and read as many b ooks as you want, but you&#39;ll likely never be as smart as Thomas Edison or Albert Einstein were. This shouldn&#39;t deter you, as there is no universally charismatic entertainer. Some people like my videos, while others don&#39;t. You&#39;ll never be able to please everybody. While I don&#39;t think there is a universally charismatic person, I do believe certain types o f charisma are more liked than others. The same goes for looks. I think Beyonce is attractive, but every man won&#39;t fi</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nd her attractive; however, I think it&#39;s fair to say more men would find Beyonce more attractive thanGrace Jones. Alt hough no one is charismatic to everyone, some personalities are liked more than others. So what&#39;s my point? The poi nt is although I&#39;m more popular than other dating coaches on YouTube, they still have their own following and are a ble to make a living doing what they love to do. The take-home message is that you shouldn&#39;t concern yourself with someone who is more liked by more individuals than you are; just appreciate the people who do like you for who yo u are.The next category of charisma is friendship charisma. Some people just have an easier time making friends, wh ile others struggle. Of the three, this is the one that I think can be improved upon the most, because I believe this is more about social skills-or lack thereof. If you&#39;re struggling to make friends, maybe you have an overbearing person ality or are unreliable, untrustworthy, talkative, or not a good listener, to name a few things. The funny thing is, this could be an individual who&#39;s good with the ladies but struggles to make friends or vice versa. This form of charisma doesn&#39;t correlate with the others. Just because you can make a lot of friends doesn&#39;t mean you could build a large foll owing. All three of these categories require a different skill set. As I&#39;ve mentioned before, just because you aren&#39;t the kind of individual that can build a social circle of 5 hundred people shouldn&#39;t deter you from trying to make friends. Although someone else may have the personality to garner a thousand friends, in actuality a very small circle could be just as good. All you need is a couple of dependable friends you can count on. Don&#39;t let others&#39; large social circles make you feel unwanted. Have an abundance mindset, and just know you will be liked by someone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 20</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How to Get Your Ex Back</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I teach having an abundance mindset, but let&#39;s assume for whatever reason your woman lost interest, and you really want her back. The only reason I believe a man should want his ex back is that he knows his screwing up caused her to lose interest. If you never stopped dating your woman, never got off your purpose, kept yourself in relatively goo d shape, and made sure the relationship kept its sexual chemistry, and she still lost interest, you shouldn&#39;t want her b ack. That&#39;s because she probably left you for another guy who she found more attractive or she just wanted somethin g new. In my estimation, if she left you once for that reason, then what&#39;s to keep her from doing it again?However, if you let yourself go physically, lost your ambition in the relationship, and started showing insecurities, and after find ing my work you now know what you did wrong and you&#39;ve decided you want your woman back, then I think in this situation, it&#39;s justified since the loss of interest was your fault.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although you want her back, it&#39;s still her call. You can&#39;t reach out to her first because it shows you are desperate and lack confidence in your ability to find someone else better. You have to just move on with your life, and maybe ove r time, her interest level will go back up due to you showing strength and not pursuing her. If you don&#39;t pursue, there&#39; s a good chance she will reach out in a few weeks if she was ever attached to you at some point, despite losing that a ttachment. She&#39;ll probably reach out with what I call a&quot;feeler&quot; call. A &quot;feeler&quot; call is when a woman&#39;s curiosity has g otten the best of her, and she&#39;s curious as to what you&#39;ve been up to these past few weeks or months. Understand that if you lost a woman&#39;s interest via acting weak and insecure, then you&#39;re not in a position to be demanding. In other words, I don&#39;t recommend you asking, &quot;How are you willing to make this up to me?&quot; because her interest is at a low point. Despite her reaching out, she&#39;s still in control.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Asking a woman &quot;How are you willing to make this up to me?&quot; should be reserved for when you break up or pull ba ck from her due to her bad behavior or when you know you were doing everything right and she still wanted out, pro bably due to another guy being in the picture.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If she lost interest due to weak behavior, then technically she&#39;s in the power position despite reaching out to you first because her interest is so low that she probably couldn&#39;t care less about getting back with you at that particular mom ent. If you&#39;re lucky enough to get this &quot;feeler&quot; call, the best thing that can come out of your mouth is about how you&#39; ve been bettering yourself because, believe me, she&#39;s going to ask. You might hear her ask, &quot;So what have you been up to these last few weeks?&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is when you can let her know you&#39;re back on your grind. This isn&#39;t you trying to sell yourself as a beta-male pro vider but rather as a focused man who has found his ambition again. In other words, you&#39;ve gotten your swagger bac</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">k. Maybe you&#39;ve decided to open that business you had been talking about so much. Maybe you&#39;ve gotten back in th e gym and lost that beer belly you gained during the relationship that caused her to loose sexual desire for you. In a r</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">elationship, ambition is highly important to a woman because of their hypergamous nature. Women need to see cons tant improvement. Even if a woman is with a man because he&#39;s a sexual alpha, at some point that thrill will wear off, and she&#39;ll want to see some ambition eventually. I think the phrase is &quot;Love don&#39;t pay no bills.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ambition is a masculine trait, and a woman shouldn&#39;t have more ambition and drive than her man does. A content m an is a single man. It doesn&#39;t matter if you make $5 millio a year; a man should be trying to figure out how to make $ 10 million a year. A man who loses his purpose in life is a needy, insecure man who naturally turns a woman off. A man without a purpose is an available man, which is highly unattractive.What you don&#39;t want to happen is for her to reach out to find that nothing has changed. How is that supposed to help raise her interest? Women intuitively know that you&#39;ll be the same insecure man that you were before she left you. If she does reach out to you, you should by n o means ask her out. There&#39;s a very good chance she&#39;s not there yet. If you do ask her out, she&#39;ll likely decline, and y ou have to start all over again. You should by no means call her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After the initial feeler call, it might take her a few more weeks to get back to the point where she wants to actually se e you. You shouldn&#39;t be having two-hour phone calls either. she&#39;ll likely reach out sparingly every couple of weeks o r so.You should keep the calls to no longer than 5 minutes before letting her know you&#39;re swamped with work. You&#39;r e sending a signal that she&#39;s no longer the most important thing in your life; your purpose is. That&#39;s exactly what a w oman subconsciously wants to hear. Hearing this lets her know she doesn&#39;t have the burden of being your entire life, which is too much of a burden for anyone, men included. By this time, the guy she&#39;s likely dating is starting to show insecurities and weakness. I know what you&#39;re thinking: I have to ask her out because it&#39;s unlikely she&#39;ll ask me out, right? This isn&#39;t just about getting your woman back. Trust me when I say you don&#39;t want a woman back when she h as the power. You only should want her back if you have her complete respect, and she&#39;s following your program. I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s possible to raise a woman&#39;s interest back up much after it&#39;s dropped, but if you&#39;re just hell - bent on getting your woman back , I&#39;m not here to judge. Your best bet is to get her to pursue you after a breakup. This is yo ur best opportunity to reset the relationship. Women want a man who doesn&#39;t put them on a pedestal. The reason for this is men tend to gravitate more toward the woman and away from their purpose, causing her to lose interest. This could also be why she reached back out initially: she saw the signs the other man was putting her first again. A man with a purpose has no competition in dating due to the lack of other men with drive and ambition , especially once th is man has found a woman he really likes and wants to spend time with.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When she&#39;s at the point when she wants to see you, she&#39;ll say something to the effect of &quot;Well, if you ever want to ha ng out, I&#39;m off on Saturdays.&quot; Remember, although you want your ex back, you shouldn&#39;t be waiting for her. You sh ould act as if she&#39;s gone and is never coming back. Only a small number of men are lucky enough to have a woman r each back out to them after they exhibit such weak behavior. Women are fickle creatures, and once they&#39;ve left the r elationship emotionally, they&#39;re gone for good.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 21</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manipulation is for Low-Value Men</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;ve been accused of being a master manipulator. If you have that interpretation of me, then you don&#39; t understand wh at I teach. I teach how to become high-value men and how to value their time. Women will use you for free dates an d validation. It&#39;s up to you to appreciate your time and not let women who have no interest in you romantically waste your time. When I advise men to pull back, it&#39;s not to manipulate women; it&#39;s because you&#39;re so focused on your pur pose in life that she gets less of your time, or her behavior warrants receiving more of your time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">High-value men, spend time doing the things you enjoy, and if her behavior isn&#39;t allowing you to enjoy her company as much as you used to, then you should pull back. That&#39;s the only manipulation if you&#39;re doing it as a strategy. It ju st so happens to be what drives women crazy emotionally, but that&#39;s just a by-product of focusing on your purpose, n ot the sole reason.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If you pull back, a woman only chases your validation if it means anything. If you&#39;re not striving to become a high-v alue man and instead have relegated yourself and are faking your value, then it&#39;s manipulation. See the difference? It&#39; s all a matter of perspective. If you resigned yourself to just pretending to be busy, you must understand that everyth ing comes to light eventually.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Faking high-value only lasts for so long before the insecurities and neediness, which men who aren&#39;t focused on thei r purpose always have, show up eventually. You don&#39;t break up with a woman because you&#39;re trying to manipulate h er into having higher interest. You break up with a woman because the value she&#39;s bringing to your life doesn&#39;t outw eigh the negativity she brings.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re finding my work and you haven&#39;t discovered your purpose in life, I still advise showing high-value tendenci es at the beginning, but this should be a band-aid, not a solution. Faking your value for extended periods is going to do is have you meet the woman of your dreams only to lose her because of your insecurities. A genuinely high-value man is the only long-term solution. If you don&#39;t know how to become a genuinely high-value man, then I advise you to read my first book, Alpha Male Strategies: Dating in the Social Media Age.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 22</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why Most Men Want a Relationship</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I used to always get into relationships when I was younger. Perhaps the biggest reason for this was my inability to b e alone. I didn&#39;t feel complete if I didn&#39;t have a girl who I could call my own. Looking back on it now, that&#39;s probabl y why I had so many different girlfriends in my twenties. If your main motivation for wanting a relationship is to av oid loneliness, then you&#39;re only going to lose that relationship. The reason for this is a woman should just be one asp ect of your life and not your entire life. You should have hobbies, friends, and a purpose in life when she enters it. A nother reason I always preferred to be in relationships when I was younger was the number of games women play. A s I&#39;m sure any single man can attest to, women, especially younger women, have an abundance of options, and theref ore they&#39;re getting pulled in so many directions that they don&#39;t know if they&#39;re coming or going. Trying to maintain a young, beautiful woman&#39;s attention beyond two weeks can be daunting at times, causing men to get frustrated and t o seek a steady relationship. When I was in my twenties, I didn&#39;t have a purpose or hobbies, and therefore female val idation and companionship were all I would seek out. When you have a life you enjoy without women, this constant revolving door of women doesn&#39;t bother you because your life isn&#39;t dependent on female companionship. That&#39;s why</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">, although I&#39;m in my late thirties at the time of this writing, I don&#39;t get frustrated when women don&#39;t act accordingly. Women are a small, insignificant part of my life. Last, I&#39;m well aware of men&#39;s great urge to start a family. If you&#39;re a purple- pill guy and you want to start a family, I can understand that. To be honest, most men who claim they&#39;re re d pill today will ultimately go purple pill at some point in their lives. I&#39;m not against men wanting families-or even a girlfriend, for that matter-as I&#39;ve stated multiple times in regard to myself. I&#39;m open to the possibility of getting in a r elationship, but I&#39;m so content and happy with my life that it would take one hell of a woman. So if you want to start a family, my only suggestion is to avoid marriage, as the laws don&#39;t benefit men in the event of the relationship not l asting. Most men think a prenuptial agreement protects them, but prenups aren&#39;t 100% foolproof, as family courts no w void a lot of prenups if women can prove there were pressured into signing them. A lot of prenups also only prote ct the assets you accumulated before the marriage. Anything gained after marriage can be disputed. Maybe you&#39;re on e of the lucky ones who maintains all of his assets after the marriage, but this is something that isn&#39;t worth the risk in my opinion. Women like the security marriage provides, so be prepared to hear ultimatums about marriage in the rel ationship. Also make sure the woman views you as an alpha male, not a beta male. When a woman views you as an alpha male, you1l get a lot more cooperation and a longer leash in hard times. Just make sure that if you decide to ge t into a relationship, you don&#39;t do it out of fear of loneliness. Loneliness isn&#39;t nearly as bad as getting into a toxic rela tionship.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 23 Intuition</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To me, having intuition is just another phrase for insecurity when it comes to relationships. Whether you&#39;re married or just in a long-term, monogamous relationship, there will be times when your intuition tells you something is not ri ght. Maybe her daily pattern has changed, or she just doesn&#39;t seem as loving as she once did. While your intuition co uld be correct and she could be stepping out on you, my advice is to not say anything without proof. Discussing your suspicion with her prematurely is definitely an attraction killer. I don&#39;t advocate snooping or turning into a private in vestigator either. What I do advise is for you to get back to doing what you were doing in the beginning so you allev iate these assumptions. Women are methodical when it comes to planning, so it&#39;s highly unlikely you1l catch her in t</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">he act, even if she is cheating. More than likely, though, your assumptions are unfounded and completely in your mi nd. These assumptions say more about you than they do about her. Women cheat when they&#39;re with a man they perc eive as a beta and not with a man they perceive as an alpha. The man she perceives as alpha creates sexual tension a nd turmoil; the man she perceives as a beta male simply can&#39;t duplicate this effect. While the man she perceives as a beta male provides financial stability, he doesn&#39;t provide the excitement that a man she&#39;s highly attracted to does. Ke ep in mind that attraction isn&#39;t just physical but rather the complete sex-appeal package, which is all the more reason why it&#39;s important for men to not get into monogamous relationships with women who view them as beta males. Wh en you&#39;re in a relationship with a woman who views you as a beta male, you&#39;ll always have this intuition throughout the relationship. A woman could be with a man she perceives as an alpha male and still cheat because they&#39;re not co nnecting anymore. In other words, he&#39;s stopped dating his woman. Remember, dating isn&#39;t just going to nice restaura nts; it&#39;s the entire &quot;experience&quot; of being with you. The fact you have so much time on your hands to calculate her sch edule is a problem in itself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women create space in the relationship due to an overbearing boyfriend or spouse. Women do change their patterns, but that&#39;s not necessarily to cheat but rather to create space because they&#39;re getting bored in therelationship. I won&#39;t deny the fact that men and women both cheat in relationships, but unlessyou have proof, confronting her just shows the woman you&#39;re afraid to lose her. My thinkinggoes as follows: If you can find a man better than me, I wish you an d him the best. Thereason I feel this way is I feel I&#39;m a catch, and any woman lucky enough to date me should appre ciate that. I more than welcome the competition. High-value men never think there&#39;s a better man out there than the mselves; therefore, we never have these intuitive fears. High-value men are too busy pursuing their passions to worr y about why their woman came home ten minutes later today. When a man isn&#39;t doing what he is supposed to do in t he relationship, all these fears come into play. If you&#39;re having these intuitive fears, then I suggest you first look at y our behavior. Remember, women need space, and if you don&#39;t provide it, they1l find it themselves. It&#39;s always better for you to do it because if she has to do it, then it means her attraction level is lower at the moment. This doesn&#39;t mea n it&#39;s always going to be that way, but for the moment it is. You can provide the space either through pursuing your purpose or through hobbies you enjoy with friends. This allows her to miss you and never have a reason to create sp ace. If she is cheating, then I believe everything in the dark comes to light eventually. This is another reason I believ e a man should never get into a relationship with a woman who sees him as a beta, because I believe this increases th e chances of a woman cheating on him. A man whom a woman perceives as a beta could never bring that lust and pa ssion out of her the way a man she perceives as an alpha male can. Women need the stability the beta male can provi de, but she also needs that passion a man she perceives as alpha can provide. Remember, it&#39;s all her perception; there is no universally alpha or beta male.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 24</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When Should You Never Take a Woman Back?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I teach men to leave women to gain a woman&#39;s respect. A lot of men might argue that you should never take a woma n back. Their reasoning for this is that if it didn&#39;t go right the first time, what has changed? I counter that argument a s follows: most women will subconsciously test to see if you have the strength to leave.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I believe it&#39;s inevitable you have to leave women to show you have the strength to do so, there are situations when y ou should never take a woman back. A couple of situations when you should never take a woman back are when a w oman leaves you for another man, or you catch her cheating. The reason for this is it&#39;s probable she only wants you b ack because that relationship went south.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If she did it once, she&#39;ll do it again. This shows you she&#39;s a cheater because she was dating that guy while she was sti ll with you. Trust is very important to men, and if you can&#39;t trust her, you&#39;ll spend every available minute trying to ke ep tabs on her. If you&#39;re insecure because you&#39;re not following your purpose or engaging in hobbies you enjoy, that&#39;s one thing, but it&#39;s a different story if you&#39;re insecure because you have trust issues brought on by an untrustworthy pa rtner. You&#39;ll never trust her again-and rightfully so.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Loyalty is a trait that is either in you or not. Even if you exhibited weak behavior and she wanted a more masculine man, she should have ended things before dating anyone else. If you caught her cheating, who knows how long this went on? Another situation when you should never take a woman back is when she is physically abusive. Society thi</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nks it&#39;s funny when a woman hits a man, but I don&#39;t find it funny. Although women may not be as strong as men phy sically, nobody should put their hands on you. I advise men to walk away and not retaliate when hit by a woman.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Women hitting men is a sign of the respect she has for you, and as we all know, nobody can love you without respec ting you. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to regain a woman&#39;s love and respect once it&#39;s gotten this low-if at all- so it does n o good to walk away and then accept her back. It also shows the violent tendencies she has, because there are plenty of women who date or are in relationships with weak men who never resort to physical assault no matter how weak t he man shows himself to be.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 25</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Breaking Down Male Nature</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There&#39;s a ton of material discussing the many flaws of the female nature, but men rarely discuss the flaws of the mal e nature. First and foremost, men are controlled by their penises. It&#39;s been said that men think about sex every seven seconds. While I can&#39;t attest to the validity of that statement for every man, as far as I go, it sounds about right. Whe n a woman is seeking a male to mate with, female nature dictates that she should seek the strongest genes and physic al features. Society refers to these men as alpha males. I don&#39;t believe there are any universally alpha males, so I&#39;ll re fer to them as men whom women perceive as alpha males. This is why a woman must test you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This testing allows her to know which category you go in. Just don&#39;t confuse a woman testing you with her having a low interest. There&#39;s a distinct difference. We similarly test women subconsciously. When a man invites a woman ov er without having gone on a date, this allows him to know how easy the woman is subconsciously. Some men might refer to this as being direct, but as my momma used to say, people know who to play with. A man would never ask a strong, confident woman over to his place without having gone on a date first. If a woman accepts this offer, we mi ght appreciate the high interest, but we usually respect the woman who makes us wait a date or two more. Although alpha males have a unique understanding of the female nature and don&#39;t usually judge women who casually sleep aro und, it&#39;s human nature to value anything you have to work for as opposed to something that&#39;s just given to you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lots of women are taught this, and this is the primary reason women make men wait despite them having extremely high interest. This is commonly referred to as social programming. When a woman is ready to start a family, female nature dictates that she should seek the highest-value male she can to support the family. Society refers to these men as beta males. As I mentioned before, I don&#39;t think there is a universally beta male, so I&#39;ll refer to these men as men whom women perceive as beta males. Preferably, a woman would want an all-around alpha for this task, but she usu ally settles for a man she perceives as a beta-male provider. This is mainly due to the scarcity of men whom women perceive as all-around alpha. When that man can no longer provide, the woman will likely discard him and find a ma n who can.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This doesn&#39;t happen overnight, as most women will allow the man time to get his life back on track-but the clock is t icking. Selfish as this may seem to men, it&#39;s the survival of the fittest. Women are hardwired to do what&#39;s in the best interest of their offspring or potential offspring. Notice that most of the female nature is centered around reproductio n and providing for offspring. Coincidentally, that&#39;s what male nature is centered around. There are no ifs or buts ab out it; men want to get laid. The biggest component of the male nature is our competitive nature toward other males. This is mostly due to the internal competition men go through to sleep with the hottest and fittest women. The reaso n we&#39;re drawn to hot and fit women is the same reason women are drawn to strong, confident, tall men.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We instinctively want to reproduce healthy, good-looking kids. Notice I said &quot;tall&quot; men. That&#39;s because it&#39;s a fact tha t women &quot;prefer&quot; taller men, but don&#39;t confuse a &quot;preference&quot; with a necessity. I prefer a woman with double-D brea sts, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a necessity. The issue with a man&#39;s competitive nature is it can cause one of two things in a man. One thing it can cause jealousy. The other thing it can cause is an inspiration. A jealous man is akin to a hy pergamous woman. They both can cause great harm. Men&#39;s testosterone level dictates a competitive nature with othe r males, but some men use this competitive nature to inspire them to perform greater deeds, while others use it to fue l their jealous rage. Men don&#39;t hate men just for the sake of hating on other men. Men hate on other men because the y&#39;re receiving the female attention they want to receive. I challenge all men to use that competitive nature to push the m to strive for greater things as opposed to using it for destruction. I classify it as destruction because it&#39;s self-destru</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ctive.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you expend energy to hate other men, it takes a lot of time and energy. You could have used that same energy for something productive, like pursuing your purpose in life. A lot of individuals would characterize jealousy as a fe male trait, and that statement may have some validity to it because we all know how feminized society has become. Men do have a lot of feminine characteristics. I, however, hold firm on my stance that jealousy comes from men&#39;s co mpetitive nature.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You see it also when women are competing for men&#39;s attention. Ambition and drive are characteristics that every ma le should have. A lot of men lack ambition, and that directly correlates with why so many men have such low sexual market value. Ambition is fueled by a man&#39;s insatiable appetite for sex. Most men would deny this fact, and that &#39;s b ecause most men are unaware of what drives them subconsciously.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even if they&#39;re in a long-term relationship or marriage, every man subconsciously knows a lot of their worth to a wo man is influenced by how they&#39;re able to provide-unless a woman perceives you as an alpha male. That perception is largely due to her interest level. Every man who&#39;s been in a relationship knows that sex dries up if financial hardshi ps come about. This is because women lose all sexual desire when they&#39;re stressed about financial security.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lots of men lack ambition due to the society we live in today. We live in a society where everyone gets a trophy. M ost men would rather spend time complaining about women&#39;s hypergamous nature or feeling sorry for themselves as opposed to improving themselves. Last, men&#39;s nature is centered around an insane sex drive. While this is ideal for r eproduction, this insane sex drive is what allows women to manipulate men with impunity. This insane sex drive is a lso what drives men to try pretty much any strategy to sleep with a woman. This is commonly referred to in the datin g world as a game. Most women recognize this at an early age and use it to their advantage. This allows women to st rategically manipulate men for their time, resources, relationships, and even marriage. Understand that a woman isn&#39; t holding a gun to a man&#39;s head to receive these things. Men do it of their own free will in the hope of scoring points with the woman to ultimately sleep with her. This is why it&#39;s so important for a man to have a purpose in life. When a man has a purpose, it becomes a man&#39;s pastime, as opposed to chasing skirts. If left unchecked, a man would presu mably spend all his free time pursuing women. Having purpose allows a man&#39;s big head to control his little head. On ce a man has control of his little head, he is no longer able to be manipulated. This is because once you become a hig h-value male, you no longer tolerate low interest. You simply don&#39;t have time for it due to the amount of time you sp end pursuing your purpose in life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 26</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To Be Great, You Have to Sacrifice</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A question I get hit with a lot is &quot;How do I attract a lot of women while following my purpose?&quot; I always reply with &quot;You can&#39;t attract a lot of women while following your purpose.&quot;The reason I respond this way is if you want to attr act a lot of women, you have to live a life of social abundance. So the correct question would be &quot;How do I attract w omen while I&#39;m on my purpose?&quot; because a lot isn&#39;t plausible. A life of social abundance means you&#39;re out at least 4 or 5 evenings a week. As with everything in life, you get what you put into it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you want to live a financially successful life with a thriving business, then you&#39;re going to have to put in the work. If you want to have a revolving door of women, then you have to put yourself in the position to meet these women by always being out and about-unless you&#39;re relying heavily upon dating apps, which means you&#39;re probably dating a lot of subpar women. My advice is, if you&#39;re a red-pill guy and want to live more of the non-monogamous - that is, polygamous-lifestyle, you should sacrifice a for a little while to build yourself up before you become a full-bore wo manizer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Just think for a second: wouldn&#39;t it be easier to juggle multiple women once you&#39;ve made yourself successful financi ally? No matter how cheap you try to keep things, dating multiple women isn&#39;t cheap. Even if you&#39;re just getting drin ks at happy hour, you&#39;ll quickly find out that dating multiple women can add up-not to mention that some women wi ll only give men who appear to be successful the time of day. Wouldn&#39;t it be better to date a couple of women on the weekend for now and invest the other money you would spend dating other women? That way, your money is worki</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ng for you passively later on. This is called delayed gratification.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you want to maximize your womanizing, then you want to make yourself attractive to these kinds of women as we ll. I&#39;m not talking about gold diggers; I&#39;m talking about the average woman who prefers a man with his stuff together</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">. Quite frankly, I don&#39;t see anything wrong with that. The overwhelming majority of women you date aren&#39;t going to consider you an alpha male initially. You&#39;re not maximizing your potential if you don&#39;t want to sleep with women w ho perceive you as a beta male. Now, getting into a relationship with a woman who perceives you as a beta male is a different subject. Men are quick to get upset with women for wanting stability, but men are only attracted to a wom an&#39;s beauty for the most part. I tell guys all the time that I had sex with more women when I was living in a basemen t with no car and making thirty grand a year in New York City than I do now driving an S550 Mercedes, living in a nice apartment in the city, and making over twenty times more than what I was making as a bouncer. How could that be? I just said money makes you more viable to more women. The thing is if you&#39;re going to spend twenty-5 hours of the day chasing women, then just by chance you&#39;re going to get some; it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re homeless.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The point I&#39;m trying to make is that I left a lot of sex on the table because there were women who lost interest once t hey saw how I lived. Some pretty hot ones lost interest too, and it stung. The better approach would be to get your lif e in order first, then you don&#39;t lose women whom you have a good chance with because you live at home with your mom or you don&#39;t have a vehicle. There&#39;s no worse feeling in the world than to have a woman who finds you attracti ve but loses interest because you don&#39;t have anything going for yourself. Don&#39;t waste your early years chasing wome n; when you get to be my age, you&#39;ll regret it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 27</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lying to Women Shows Insecurities</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A lot of men have misinterpreted women&#39;s method. If you&#39;re a man who&#39;s just finding my work and you&#39;re not follo wing your purpose in life or living a social life of abundance, then I advocate lying to create value until you become busy. It&#39;s a Band-Aid and not a lifestyle. It&#39;s much easier to just figure out your purpose than it is to constantly lie to create value.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Being too available is a sign of low sexual market value, and the average woman loses interest. If you&#39;re a red-pill m an and a woman asks you, &quot;Are you looking or open to a relationship?&quot; I advocate replying with &quot;If the right woman comes along,&quot; and &quot;I like to take my time and not rush into things.&quot; That&#39;s not a lie in my book, as every man, whet her they know it or not, is open to a relationship if the right woman comes along, even if they&#39;re red pill.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Red-pill men&#39;s standards are so high as to what an ideal woman is that it would admittedly take an extraordinary wo man to entice them to settle down. That aside, men have taken my advice for lying to women to mean lying about ev ery single thing they can. A good way to end up with busted windows and slashed tires is to lie about being monoga mous when you aren&#39;t. Never commit to a woman just so you can get sex unless you&#39;re truly ready to be in a monoga mous relationship. If you aren&#39;t read my lying-to- for a relationship, just let her know that you&#39;re not in that place yet</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">, and she either has the choice to keep seeing you or to move on. Lying about things like this causes way too many p roblems and headaches.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Also, some guys try to lie about their finances, and some short men even try to lie about something as silly as their h eight when using online dating. I&#39;ll be the first to admit using online dating as a tool to meet women should be kept t o a minimum because women are pickier online, and one of the things they&#39;re very picky about is height. If you&#39;re sh ort and decide to use online dating to meet women, you&#39;re at a tremendous disadvantage. Most women are going to d isqualify you immediately. Be that as it may, you still shouldn&#39;t try to lie about this. For one, some women aren&#39;t attr acted to short men. High-value, short men value their time and would never risk their valuable time by showing up t o meet a woman who isn&#39;t attracted to short men.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As a high-value man, you have to have the mindset that your time is important and that you only want to give it to p eople who accept you for who you are. Additionally, this leads to a bigger point. Lying about your height shows a w oman that you get rejected a lot and that your assumption as to why you&#39;re getting rejected is your height. It also poi nts out your insecurity about your height.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You have just subconsciously let a woman know you have a low sexual market value. Your height didn&#39;t give you th e low sexual market value, but rather your insecurity about your height. Lying about your financial situation present s the same problems. A woman who wants a man with his stuff together isn&#39;t going to just take your word for it. Wo men who want men who already have their lives together are going to ask questions and observe you to determine if you truly have your life in order.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you don&#39;t have your life together, a lot of women won&#39;t consider you to be a potential sexual partner in the same w ay some men won&#39;t consider an overweight woman to be a potential sexual partner. However, there are a lot of wom en who would be willing to work with you as long as they see you moving in the right direction. You don&#39;t want to waste your time dating women who aren&#39;t willing to work with you on your financial situation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even if you meet a woman who&#39;s willing to work with you on your financial situation, she&#39;ll lose her attraction if she sees you exaggerating your financial situation. She&#39;ll assume that you must not be too successful with women and th at you have resorted to lying about your financial situation as a way to attract them. Do yourself a favor and just let women know that you aren&#39;t where you want to be financially but that you&#39;re working hard to improve upon that. Eit her that&#39;s good enough, or it isn&#39;t.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Chapter 28</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Why Your Wife or Girlfriend Won&#39;t Have Sex with You</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I&#39;ve already addressed how to be better in the bedroom in my first book, but guys in extended relationships have bee n asking me how to get their woman to have sex more often. This is one of the pitfalls of being in a relationship with a woman who sees you as a beta male. Maybe initially she perceived you as an alpha, but as your feelings develope d, you were no longer that strong, masculine guy who knew how to take control of any situation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Most guys can start with the power in the relationship, but the woman slowly starts to run the relationship over time. The reason for this transition is because she&#39;s now your only source of sex. When a woman pouts early in the relatio nship, and the man doesn&#39;t cave, she later withholds sex as a means to get her way. If you cave, you must understand you&#39;re training your woman to withhold sex to have her way.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When I was a kid and would throw a tantrum, my mother didn&#39;t just let me have my way because she knew that wou ld only encourage more inappropriate behavior. Technically, every woman in a relationship can control the relations hip if the relationship is monogamous.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Don&#39;t give me that crap about women wanting sex as much as men when we have eight to ten times the testosterone levels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Once you give a woman the power in the relationship by giving her a commitment, your only recourse is for her to k now that not pleasing you is a cause for separation. Most men think that a woman not sleeping with them isn&#39;t groun ds for breaking up, but I disagree with this assertion. When you give a woman a commitment, she&#39;s now solely respo nsible for keeping your needs met.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">She has to understand the two of you are not about to argue overnight about sex, and you damn sure aren&#39;t about to d o her any favors for her to sleep with you. I know you&#39;re thinking to yourself, &quot;Here he goes, telling us to leave our g irls again,&quot; but men must have boundaries and deal breakers in relationships.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It doesn&#39;t matter if the relationship is non-monogamous or monogamous. Once you enter a monogamous relationship</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: -3pt;text-align: justify;">,it&#39;s easy for a woman to manipulate the relationship by withholding sex. Let&#39;s assume the reason she is withholding sex isn&#39;t to manipulate the relationship and let&#39;s then assume the answer isn&#39;t you not pleasing her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I would then suggest you try to have more risque sex, like sex on the beach or sex in the park. If you&#39;re afraid of gett ing caught, then that&#39;s part of your problem. You need to spice things up. Show her you have a dangerous side. I for one get very bored of the same sex over and over, hence why I&#39;m a noncommittal type of guy. Most people confuse</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">my unwillingness to commit with me wanting to avoid heartbreak, but that&#39;s not true.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The number one reason I don&#39;t commit is I know how quickly I get bored having sex with the same woman. Maybe you could go out dancing and screw her brains out in the bathroom - who knows? Just try to switch things up a little bit. She could just be bored. Remember that movie Unfaithful with Richard Gere? I know it&#39;s just a movie, but it has a lot of truth to it. You should be doing this anyway, but let&#39;s assume you haven&#39;t been; you could try having a life o utside of her, like activities you enjoy so she can wonder about you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In this phase, she starts to wonder if you&#39;re seeing someone else, which creates just enough tension to light her fire a gain. This isn&#39;t manipulation, as a man, you have to cultivate a life outside of your woman. It just so happens this do es manipulate her emotions, but that&#39;s not your problem. Spicing things up sexually should do it. If you decided to g et into a relationship with a woman who perceives you as a beta male, then this is on you. You got into a relationshi p with a woman who has a low attraction to you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If you got into a relationship with a woman who perceived you as an alpha male and she doesn&#39;t want to sleep with y ou, it&#39;s because she no longer views you as an alpha male and has the same attraction to you as she would a man she now perceives as a beta. Women cannot submit to men they don&#39;t respect, and that&#39;s what a woman is doing when sh e sleeps with you. Another thing to consider if you&#39;re having this issue is your financial situation. When women are s tressed about anything - particularly finances-their sex drive goes into the toilet.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Chapter 29</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Whoever Cares the Least Holds the Power</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Most men have heard the age-old saying, &quot;The person who cares less has the most power,&quot; but how does one go abo ut this? Of course, if you meet a woman you&#39;re very attracted to and who&#39;s very feminine, you&#39;re going to care about her. So what should you do?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Well, a lot of men try to solve this problem by getting into relationships with less attractive women out of fear of not being able to maintain their emotional strength with a woman who lights their fire. I don&#39;t advise men to get with les s than stellar women to avoid losing their emotional center. The trick is to get the woman to care more about you tha n you care about her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: -3pt;text-align: justify;">You do this by continually improving your sexual market value throughout the relationship. This should keep you in the abundance mindset. You also have to maintain sexual chemistry by not getting too comfortable in the relationshi</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">p. If you want her to treat you like a brother, then act like her brother. If you&#39;re going to keep her feminine and subm issive, you have to maintain a masculine sexual frame throughout the relationship. This is harder than it sounds, but i t can be done with a little self-control. It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re head over heels in love; as long as she values your v alidation enough to chase it, then you have the power.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once she starts to devalue your validation because you give it away so freely, then you have a problem. Remember, the most significant validation you can give a woman is your time. Once she knows she can see you anytime she wa nts, there&#39;s no need to chase your validation because you give it away so readily. I don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve h ad to say this, but as a high-value man, you have to remain busy to keep your woman attracted. Working on your pur pose feeds her hypergamous needs, and socializing with friends gives you social proof. If done correctly, your time with her will remain limited, which keeps her chasing your validation, which in tum gives you the power.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 30 Make Her Invest</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">One reason that men have a hard time keeping a woman attached is they fail to keep the woman invested in the relati onship. The reason you want women to invest is human nature to stick things out once you&#39;ve invested in a person or a project. Making a woman invest is all part of building and maintaining an attachment. This is why banks want you to put a down payment on a property or car loan. They know that if you start to have buyer&#39;s remorse, in a couple of months you&#39;ll be more inclined to stick it out if you&#39;ve made a large down payment.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women&#39;s emotions change as the wind blows; one minute they&#39;re all over you, and the next they don&#39;t want to be an ywhere near you. If you don want your woman looking for the exit at every full moon, it&#39;s best to make her invest. T here are three ways you can make a woman invest in a relationship, regardless of whether it&#39;s monogamous or non- monogamous. You can make her invest emotionally, financially, and with her time. When you make women invest e motionally, essentially you&#39;re good at making her wonder about you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You do this by limiting your nonsexual attention and validation. You can make women invest financially by having her do something as simple as buying food to cook for you. If you live with a woman, I would advise you against pa ying all the bills. While you might think providing her with the freedom of not having to pay bills is what will keep her, it presents a bigger problem, and that problem is it prevents her from investing financially in the relationship. If you&#39;re well off and money isn&#39;t a problem, I still advise you against letting her avoid investing her money in the relat ionship, even if it&#39;s just a cable bill. As humans, we are emotionally tied to our money, since most of us have to trade our valuable time for it. This is why courts make you pay fines when jail time is not an option.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">They know you&#39;ll think twice about breaking the law when you have to pay money out of your pocket, no matter ho w small the fine. If you&#39;re in a cohabitation relationship or marriage, another reason I advise you against providing f ull financial support is that this is how you can easily be perceived by her as a beta male, which lowers her attraction</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">-although she might be thankful for the support. She starts to think she has more value than you do, and you have to provide for her to compensate for your lack of sexual market value. The most effective way to get women to invest i s with their time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To me, time is the most valuable thing we have. This could be something as small as having her bring you lunch at work, stopping by the cleaners to pick up your clothes, or just bringing a bottle of wine over when she comes to visit</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">. Typically I make all my girls come to see me. In New York, this could be a nice commute back and forth with traff ic and all. I&#39;ve had women tell me they wanted to leave me because I wouldn&#39;t commit, but they just couldn&#39;t go thro ugh with it. The reason they couldn&#39;t go through with it is I made them invest so heavily in the relationship.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 31 Imprint</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An imprint is when someone makes such an impressive impression on you that you compare them to everyone you d ate thereafter. This is sort of like having an attachment that won&#39;t go away despite you not being with the person any more. For men, more times than not, this is going to be a combination of the most beautiful and the most feminine w oman they&#39;ve ever dated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Remember, a woman&#39;s feminine energy increases with her attraction level. When a woman is being feminine, she&#39;s b eing very cooperative; therefore, you won&#39;t see a whole lot of testing unless you start acting weak. A man acting wea k is a man who stops checking his woman and starts showing insecurities. There&#39;sno better feeling in the world than to be out with a cooperative woman with a high attraction level who is in her feminine energy. A woman&#39;s beauty al one won&#39;t leave an imprint because uncooperative women aren&#39;t that fun to be with - not even sexually, they&#39;ll be bar king out commands during sex.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To leave this magical imprint on a woman, you&#39;ll usually need a combination of masculinity, confidence, sex appeal, and sexual market value. When you&#39;re with a woman, she observes how much attention she gets from you, and then she&#39;s able to calculate your sexual market value - unless she&#39;s already aware of your sexual market value before datin g you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It usually happens when you date women you interact with every day, like at school or work. Outside of that, most women will do a background check of sorts. During this background check, she isn&#39;t looking for felonies or misdem eanors; she&#39;s asking around to find out if you&#39;ve dated any of her friends or what caliber of women were you dating before her. You can&#39;t leave an imprint on a woman until you&#39;re the best she&#39;s ever had and vice versa. If you&#39;re able t o leave this indelible imprint, it takes a lot to drop her attraction. You see this commonly with women who won&#39;t lea ve a man who&#39;s been caught cheating several times or won&#39;t stay employed. Once you&#39;ve imprinted on a woman&#39;s mi</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nd, you have such a long rope to hang yourself with that it&#39;s virtually impossible to hang yourself. She&#39;ll stay with yo u for twenty years without a commitment, and even if she finally builds up the strength to leave, she&#39;ll usually reach back out in a couple of weeks to make up. In situations like this, it&#39;s usually the man who does the breaking up. Ther e&#39;s nothing you can do to leave an imprint on a woman but be yourself. It&#39;s more about compatibility than anything e lse. Now and then, you meet a woman and you just do it for her in every way. From the way you look to the way yo u talk, to the way you smell, you just hit everything right on the head. It&#39;s more about her taste than yours.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Maybe you have just the right amount of humor and masculinity that she likes - who knows? If you&#39;re lucky enough to leave this imprint on a woman and have a fair amount of attraction to her as well, you&#39;re in an ideal situation to ha ve your cake and eat it too. If you have a woman who&#39;s left an imprint on you, and you&#39;re no longer with her, that&#39;s n ot a good situation to be in. It could be ten years later, and you&#39;ll still be comparing every woman to her. Every wom an after that point will pale in comparison to her. You&#39;ll find yourself reminiscing quite often about how hot she was and how you were able to have sex multiple times a day, but now you&#39;re lucky if the woman you have now can stim ulate you once a week.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">My suggestion is if you ever run into a woman who leaves the magical imprint on you, to make sure you remain in y our masculine frame and keep her. The biggest issue with having a woman who&#39;s left an imprint on you is maintaini ng your frame. Although you&#39;re crazy about her, you always have to lead the relationship.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 32</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Choosing Signals Isn&#39;t a Guarantee</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I teach men to wait for choosing signals. I teach men this so they can avoid being in a constantly thirsty state and not avoid rejection. Choosing signals do signal a woman&#39;s attraction to you; however, they don&#39;t guarantee you a phone number and a date. There are a host of reasons a woman could reject you even though she was sending you choosing signals. I know it&#39;s hard for some men to comprehend, but there are women who just get a sick thrill out of throwing out signs of high interest but really just want tolead men on. Some women will give you the indication of having ge nuine interest only toreject you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some women will go even as far as to go on a date with you, give you every indication of interest known to man, on ly to ghost you later. When I was younger, we called these women &quot;teases,&quot; but the phrase used today is &quot;attention w hore.&quot; These women value your validation and attention more than they value a man&#39;s money. You typically can spo t these kinds of women right away because as soon as you approach, they go cold even though they were giving you signs of interest. Sometimes a woman could find you attractive, but she&#39;s not available. When women see a man they find physically attractive, they might admire what they see, but if a woman is taken and her man is doing everything he&#39;s supposed to do, then you won&#39;t get far.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I firmly believe that women only cheat if they&#39;re dating a beta-male provider or if a man they perceive as alpha is los ing his dominance. Sexual charisma-unless she&#39;s just no good, which, if that&#39;s the case, you shouldn&#39;t have been in a relationship with her, to begin with. If she&#39;s dating a man who&#39;s doing either of those two things, then I firmly believ e most women start taking applications. &quot;Taking applications&quot; is when a woman starts giving out her phone number or taking phone numbers to find a replacement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This could be a tedious and long search that takes many months or even years. In some instances, a woman could ha ve a &quot;plaything&quot; on the side while she lets her beta- male provider do all the providing. I saw this for many years wit h female family members cheating on their spouses. The approach you use is paramount in sealing the deal with wo men. Remember, when you approach a woman, more than likely, she doesn&#39;t know your sexual market value, so the only thing she can judge it by is your approach. In the beginning, your sexual market value isn&#39;t determined by how you look, as looks are subjective; the confidence you display during your approach is how she gauges it. Women int uitively know what a confident man sounds or doesn&#39;t sound like.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This intuition comes from years of being approached by males, like how a detective can gauge if a suspect is lying t o him. After years and years of interrogations, detectives able to pick up on certain body movements to know if som eone is lying. When you approach a woman, your voice&#39;s pitch and body&#39;s movement let her know if you&#39;re used to d</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ating women of her caliber. When you approach women who are not the typical quality of woman you date, nervous ness will be written all over you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That&#39;s why it&#39;s paramount for a man to work on himself, so he feels entitled to the quality of women he wants, and th is nervousness doesn&#39;t derail his approach. You can&#39;t fake this confidence. Either you genuinely feel entitled to the w oman, or you don&#39;t. I do think there is such a thing as having a poker face, where you can hide your nervousness, but it does have limitations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For instance, I think it&#39;s human nature to feel some nervousness approaching a stranger, but there isn&#39;t a poker face i n the world that can hide the fact that you&#39;re nervous because you feel like you&#39;ll be lucky to get a woman. Lines, to me, are corny. When I approach a woman, I try to use whatever is transpiring around us to break the ice. For exampl e, let&#39;s assume a woman on a treadmill is sending me choosing signals, and I go over and approach.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;d use the treadmill as a way to break the ice. I would say something to the effect of &#39;&#39;You must be preparing for the Boston Marathon, the way you&#39;re over here running.&quot; That would typically put a light smile on her face, and then I would introduce myself. I always wait to see if the woman introduces herself as well as a sign of genuine interest. W omen who aren&#39;t interested typically try to have a dry conversation about killing your advances. When I&#39;m referring t o a &quot;dry conversation,&quot; I&#39;m referring to her not contributing to the conversation by not asking you anything in return or giving very short answers. She does this purposefully, hoping you get the hint. In the same way, men have a game plan to attract women. Women have a game plan to reject men as soon as possible if they have absolutely no interes</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">t. Women are not like men in the respect that they don&#39;t value the importance of looks nearly as much as we do.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A woman could find you attractive physically, your approach could be confident, and she still rejects you due to you r personality. As with everything else, personality and charisma are subjective as well. What one woman thinks is s mooth and laid back, another woman may think is boring. What one woman refers to as having an outgoing personal ity, another woman refers to as immature. There are just different strokes for different folks. Some men like women who say very little, while I think these women are boring. Don&#39;t get offended if you&#39;re not a woman&#39;s cup of tea phys ically or personality-wise; just understand all you need is one woman out of billions who genuinely like you. Anythi ng you&#39;re able to attract over that is simply a luxury.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Chapter 33</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The World&#39;s Most Insecure Man</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I think it&#39;s fair to say that the average person enjoys nice things. As men, we subconsciously know that wearing nice clothes, driving a nice car, and wearing jewelry such as Rolex watches are ways of showing women we can be good providers. Of course, there is also a fair share of men who don&#39;t have a pot to piss in and a window to throw it out of but who want to give off the illusion of having financial success. Using women&#39;s hypergamous nature against them i s fair in my book.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women use our sexual desires against us to get validation, attention, and financial favors. The only women you&#39;re g oing to attract using your business success are women who are actively looking for a provider. It&#39;s fine if you&#39;re look ing for the occasional fling, but a lot of men then try to turn around and get into a committed relationship with these women. It&#39;s your life, and you&#39;re free to do what you want, but these women will never desire you the way you want them to. Another thing that a lot of men don&#39;t understand is that being excessively flashy is a sign of insecurity for a lot of women. When I was younger, the phrase I would commonly hear about men with nice cars is that the car was an extension of their penis, meaning that the car compensated for what they lacked in their pants. This same scenario plays out in women who dress like sluts and very promiscuously. There&#39;s a distinct difference between women who dress sexily and women who dress like sluts. When I see a woman who dresses like a slut, I know that&#39;s a woman wi th low self-esteem who needs constant male validation to make her feel better about herself. I feel this same way abo ut men who need the big twenty-eight-inch rims, a Rolex, a diamond bracelet, and Gucci from head to toe.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I mean, does it take all that for you to attract a woman? I know, I know, you&#39;re wearing it for yourself-yeah, right. A s with most things in life, there&#39;s a balance. You don&#39;t want to look like an insecure jackass wearing five designers at once, but you also don&#39;t want to look like you live on the street either. What I&#39;ve learned is a nice button-down shirt,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;text-align: left;">preferably custom made, ora polo-fitted shirt, if it&#39;s summertime, along with some nice fitted jeans and a good pair of designer shoes are enough. A nice watch and a ring are OK, but that&#39;s more than enough; if you need more than th at, then it&#39;s probably safe to say you don&#39;t want that kind of woman these things attract around you. I teach men to no t complain about the female nature, but rather to use it against them-and I stand by that-but spending all your money on dumb material items that depreciate is just silly and not something a truly high-value man does. Don&#39;t get me wro ng; there&#39;s nothing wrong with having nice things, but you can wear outfits that cost $5k, and it won&#39;t mean a hill of beans if the woman doesn&#39;t find you attractive or she is actively seeking a beta provider. You&#39;ll be much better off in vesting that money into something that&#39;ll create a passive income, like index funds or real estate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 34</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How I Rate Women</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Once you&#39;ve become a high-value male with options, a woman&#39;s looks are no longer all she needs to get a roster spot or, if you&#39;re the monogamous type, a committed relationship. When you&#39;re a man with plenty of available time, you&#39; ll pretty much take anything that looks decent, hence why you struggle with keeping women cooperative. It&#39;s virtuall y impossible to keep women cooperative if you have such low requirements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women can smell the desperation on you. I have a three-category rating scale I use to determine if a woman is worth y of being in my rotation. If you&#39;re the monogamous-relationship type, then you can use it to determine if a woman i s girlfriend or wife material. The number one requirement is always looking. I wish I could say the number one cate gory was personality, but I don&#39;t care what your personality is; if you can&#39;t turn me on sexually, it&#39;s a no go.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The same holds for women. Women do value confidence over everything, but you have to meet her minimum attract ion level first before your confidence can come into play. If I had to choose between a dime with a horrible personali ty and a 5 with an amazing personality, I would gladly accept the dime. I would be miserable with a woman I wasn&#39;t attracted to. Of course, I would be miserable with the dime with a bad personality, but at least I would be happy sexu ally. Now, these are two extremes, and I would prefer a woman I find highly attractive who has a great personality t oo. Thus, the next category would be personality.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Personality for women encompasses feminine energy, which is largely based on her attraction level and interest. It d oes no good having a dime who views you as a beta male because she&#39;s going to exhibit low- interest behavior throu ghout the relationship. Compatibility also plays a role in this. If you&#39;re the ultraserious type, then obviously a woman who&#39;s a little bit more laid back and goofy might not work for you, although sometimes opposites attract. The next c ategory would be responsible. Responsibility is when a woman doesn&#39;t try to live outside her means via credit card d ebt, an expensive car payment, and so on. The reason this is important is if you decide to get into a relationship with her, she&#39;ll try to get you to do the same.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You&#39;ll spend all your time working to pay for the overly extravagant lifestyle she wants. Leading to stress and tensio n throughout the relationship, ultimately leading to a breakup in the end anyway, as finances are the biggest reason marriages and long-term relationships end. It&#39;s not the money itself; it&#39;s the stress the financial situation has put on th e relationship to cause it to end. An irresponsible woman is the kind of woman who insists on going to that very exp ensive restaurant when the one you want to go to is just as good.You want women who have your best a backup plan</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">, and men show low interest by interests at heart. Ideally, I wouldn&#39;t put a woman in my rotation unless she has a co mbination of all three categories.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anything less than all three categories would deem a woman as someone who is &quot;just dating.&quot; The not contacting a woman to set dates regularly or, if she contacts them first, they don&#39;t bring up getting together. Difference between a woman in my rotation and a woman I&#39;m &quot;just dating&quot; is that women I&#39;m just dating don&#39;t get birthday or Christmas g ifts, and I&#39;m not obligated to see them regularly. Meaning I could disappear fora month before contacting them again if I so choose. I know what you&#39;re thinking: &quot;What if they don&#39;t answer when I contact them again after such a long hiatus?&quot; My response to that would be, if I cared, I wouldn&#39;t have disappeared so long, to begin with. Women show l ow interest by not setting dates or using you as free attention.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 35</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lack of Communication</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I teach men to follow their purpose in life before and during the relationship. While doing this is going to keep you d etached among other things, it&#39;s also going to cause the female to complain about a lack of communication between t he two of you. Men in relationships think this is an issue, but this is what you need to keep women attracted to you. I n my experience, women are going to complain about something because they&#39;re emotional and don&#39;t like it when thi ngs are too calm and predictable for too long-so they have to stir things up. So either she&#39;s going to complain about t he lack of quality time you&#39;regiving her or she&#39;s going to complain about the dish you left in the sink last night, but o ne thing&#39;s for sure: she&#39;s going to complain about something. As a man who&#39;s following his purpose in life, this shoul d be music to your ears. Besides the turmoil you&#39;re giving her to feed her emotional side, this is also a sign she actua lly wants to see you more. When women&#39;s attraction level drops or they view you as a beta male, they don&#39;t want to s ee you more; they want to see you less. When a woman views you as a beta-male provider, the more you work, the b etter. I can remember vividly my auntie preferring my uncle work as much as he could so he could provide more, an d she could see him less. It seems to me that she preferred that he leave the house more and more. With all this being said, as with everything else, there&#39;s a balance. Most men go from one extreme to the other. Before they find my wo rk, they go from texting their woman back within thirty seconds, texting back and forth all day, to expecting the wo man to do 100% of the pursuing overnight without ever giving one comp liment again ever. You can lower women&#39;s interest by overpursuing, but you can also lower it by underpursuing or just being a complete cold fish. If your wom an is cooperating and acting feminine, then it&#39;s OK to throw your woman a compliment once every couple of weeks. First off, if you&#39;re not throwing around compliments every day, they actual ly start to mean something when you do give her one. Even if attachment has been built, she&#39;s pursuing you, and if she&#39;s complaining nonstop about a lack of communication, try initiating contact once aweek. This shouldn&#39;t be a back-and-forth text session, but rather just a si mple &quot;Good morning.Have a productive day&#39;&#39; should do the trick. A lot of the bickering about a lack of communicati oncould be solved if the woman actually bought your story about being busy. My women never gripe that often beca use they can see all the things I&#39;m doing; therefore, they don&#39;t botherme about my lack of communication, although I do get it from time to time. This is where being a fake, high-value male comes into play. I doubt you&#39;re working a f ull-time job and studying for the bar exam at night, and these women are comp laining. The complaining comes fro m you saying you&#39;re busy, but to her, she doesn&#39;t see why you&#39;re so busy. Pretending to be a high- value male is only a Band-Aid and isn&#39;t meant to be a lifestyle because the truth always comes out.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 36</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women Don&#39;t Handle Rejection Well</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you become a high-value man, you learn to value your self-worth and lose your scarcity mindset. This means t hat you no longer allow women to friend zone you in the hope that you one day become intimate with them. Don&#39;t e xpect women to take this well and just be content with you being cordial. I teach men to never show a woman they&#39;r e butthurt about rejection - but don&#39;t play the lovable, gay male girlfriend either. In turn, you can expect women to ta ke your cordial attitude and be dismissive toward you. By cordial, I mean you mightsimply say &quot;Good morning, Mel issa&quot; and leave itat that, but since you&#39;re no longer pursuing and care to engage back and forth with a womanwho do esn&#39;t see you in that light, now she&#39;s acting butthurt. Men have to value women&#39;s attention. You should never try to b e friends with a woman you want sexually. All you&#39;re going to get is a case of blue balls on a consistent basis. The fu nny thing is, she knows you want her sexually but plays coy toward your advances to either keep you as a backup op tion or for the constant validation a beta-male orbiter gives her. The cold shoulder she gives you can rub you the wro ng way, but you should expect it from women who have rejected you and whom you&#39;ve decided to not let friend zon e you as a way for them to get constant validation. Womencompete with other women to see who can get the most b eta-male orbiters. You see this on social media where women have millions of beta-male orbiters. Oddly enough, wo men don&#39;t give out free validation. If you go to some of the biggest male models&#39; Instagram pages, you won&#39;t see a lo t of women on them giving the men free validation. What you will see, however, is more men giving away more free validation. Men have to treat their validation like women treat theirs. Women do, however, give other women free v alidation online to boost other women&#39;s ego and self-esteem. This is one of the many downsides to dating women in your everyday living situations, like work and school. I prefer to approach and date women not in my everyday livin g situation. Even if she doesn&#39;t reject you, once the dating stops, this can create an awkward situation. The key word here is &quot;prefer.&quot; I would prefer to date a woman in myeveryday living situation, just like I prefer a woman with doub le-D breasts, but it&#39;s not a requirement. If you do decide to take this path,just be aware of the downsides to dating wo</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">men in your everyday interactions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 37</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Handling Women Who Seem to Have Lost Their Interest</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As you might have guessed, I&#39;m constantly evolving my approach to women. The higher value I become, the easier I expect it to be with women. Thus, I no longer ask women out during the initial phone conversation. I simply reach o ut and wait for them to initiate contact before I ask them out. This is a modification of my former approach of asking a woman out who has seemed to pu ll back. I changed this for a couple of reasons. The first is, as a high-value man, I don&#39;t want to waste my time dating women whose interest has dropped. You heard me correct ly. Women will use you for free dates if you let them. What I&#39;ve learned is that when a woman is genuinely interested, she will initiate co ntact even if it&#39;s just a simple &quot;good morning.&quot; It doesn&#39;t take a whole lot of interest for a woman to accept a date for drinks. Understand that I&#39;m fully aware that waiting for a woman to initiate contact after I&#39;ve already initiated contac t could cost me an opportunity with some women, but you have to understand that as a high-value man, my biggest a sset is my time, not sleeping with women. This is one way that any high-value man can screen out women who aren&#39; t genuinely interested or who are losing interest. The difference between this approach and a direct approach, where sex is brought up rather quickly, is that I don&#39;t expect a woman tojump into the sack with me on the first date. All I want her to do is show genuine interest by contributing to the interaction. Another reason I&#39;ve modified my approach is that I want to set the precedent from the get-go that I&#39;m not trying to win a woman over; rather, we both should be trying to win each other over. When awoman is allowed to just sit back and let you do all the work, it can give her t he sense she is ofgreater value. As a high-value man, you must understand what you bring to the table and senda sig nal that you&#39;re a prize too. Making her initiate after a drop in interest is also your wayof making her invest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 38</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lack of a Social Life</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you become a high-value male, you quickly find out that having a purpose in life can be a gift and a curse. It&#39;s a gift because it fills that void that we all have in life when we have too much free time on our hands. However, it al so can put a damper on your social life. So what&#39;s the solution? I can&#39;t speak for everyone, but I don&#39;t grind for mater ial items; I grind for financial freedom. I define &quot;financial freedom&quot; as making more money passively than my living expenses. For example, if my living expenses are$5,000, and I make $6,000 a month passively, that&#39;s enough to cov er my monthly expensesand save something for a rainy day. If you grind to make money, but then you turn around a nd raise your living expenses to match your increase in income, you&#39;ll work until the day you die. I work a lot, but I l ook at it as a small price I&#39;m willing to pay to achieve the elusive financial freedom most of us seek. If you have a de manding job, like truck driving that puts you on the road a lot, you might find it hard to maintain lasting relationship s, monogamous or non-monogamous. My advice for anyone in these situations is to make it as short term as possible and to save your money and either pursue another career or start your own business.Truck driving has a very high tu rnover rate, and that&#39;s for a reason. The same can be said for personal training. Jobs that prevent you from socializin g for extended periods of time can lead to depression. We&#39;re social creatures, and a lack of socializing for extended p eriods of time can really impact you mentally. Life is for living and not slaving for eighty hours a week forever. I&#39;m all for short-term sacrifice, but money and success just aren&#39;t that important enough to me for me not to live a life of social abundance unless it&#39;s temporary. If you&#39;re really grinding and don&#39;t have the energy to go out often in your spa re time, then dating apps are probably going to be your best bet, despite all the pitfalls they have, because women ca n be extremely picky online. Some jobs are just not meant to be worked in the long term if you want to have a social and fulfilling life.Chapter 39 Increasing Your StatusAs men, we&#39;re unfortunately always going to have to deal with r ejection. Following choosing signals and cold approaching attractive women are and will always be a numbers game for the average man, celebrities aside. With that being said, there&#39;s a host of reasons why a woman rejects a man. If it&#39;s a woman you truly want, there&#39;s only one way you can attract her after she&#39;s rejected you, unless the rejection wa s due to her already being involved in another relationship. In that scenario, she could&#39;ve been interested but not avai lable. Men need to understand that timing is always the biggest factor when it comes to rejection. That situation asid e, the only way to gain a woman&#39;s attraction after that is to raise your status. There are threeways you can raise your status.The first way to raise your status is to raiseyour sexual market value. This is when a woman sees you dating w omen of her caliber or better. This is commonly referred to as &quot;preselection.&quot; Some men try to cheat the system and hang out with beautiful female friends as a way of trying to show they&#39;re preselected men. What men who try to do t</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">his don&#39;t understand is that women will send off signals to alpha males and other females to say that she&#39;s not with y ou. Women accomplish this feat with their body language. This will not only not accomplish your goal of raising yo ur sexual market but also can actually cause you to lose sexual market value because itwill come across to a woman that you&#39;re friend zoned, and therefore, if she didn&#39;t want you, then why should she? This is just another reason why men should not be friends with females they find attractive, besides getting the occasional case of blue balls. You&#39;re not just going to get up one day and start dating hotter women. This usually happens after you&#39;ve done some self-im provement work, which improves your confidence, which then improves your success rate. The next thing you can d o is improve your social status. &quot;Social status&quot; is just another way of saying &quot;more popular and liked.&quot; To me, this is the second biggest thing because it encompasses fame and popularity. The difference between social status and sexu al market value is that social status is about being liked by men and women, while sexual market value is basically j ust being liked by more women. This is like the captain of the football or basketbal l team in school. Joining a frater nity helps in this area, as you improve your social circle. Most women are natural networkers, and it&#39;s very attractive to them when a man has a certain level of notoriety. If you&#39;re not anathlete, a fraternity is something you&#39;re not into, or maybe you&#39;re older, then you can always just try being more liked. To be liked by more people just basically boils down to fitting in with most social situations. Having a positive energy and not being a gossiper help greatly in this area. You have to be approachable as well. Try not to talk over people. A lot of men overdo it with the idea of the m asculine frame and really make themselves unapproachab le. There&#39;s a balance with everything; you don&#39;t want to be a cornball, but you don&#39;t want to be a scowling jackass either.Last, improving your financial status is a great way to attract the woman of your dreams. Now I know a lot of men are going to say, &quot;Hey, I don&#39;t want a woman to want m e because I&#39;ve improved my financial situation&quot;-that is, they don&#39;t want to be perceived as beta males; I can understa nd that, but there&#39;s a big difference between a woman who wants shopping sprees and expensive vacations and one who just wants a man who has his stuff together. A woman could find you very attractive and view you as an alpha male, but if you live with your mother, she doesn&#39;t want to date you. In my opinion, there&#39;s nothing wrong with a wo man who wants a man who has something going for himself, because quite frankly, I don&#39;t like women who have not hing going for themselves. If you think that it&#39;s stupid for women to want a man who is stable, then I guess we know why you&#39;re struggling with women. I made this the last item because while it does happen, typically making more m oney won&#39;t change a woman&#39;s mind unless it&#39;s a substantial amount. Be that as it may, it does happen. If my memory serves me correctly, I remember Steve Harvey saying something to the effect of his last wife telling him early in his career that he didn&#39;t make enough money for her, but after his career took off, she had a change of heart. So it does happen, but usually if a woman finds you attractive-and by attractive I&#39;m referring to looks and personality-she&#39;ll giv e you a chance if she&#39;s available and sees that you are trying. On average, though, if a woman rejects you most of the time, improving your financial situation won&#39;t increase her attraction unless she just wants to use you or is looking f or a beta-male provider, which means that she has low attraction. Dating women who are with you solely for financi al reasons is definitely no fun, as you&#39;ll never feel missed or wanted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 40</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dating Women with Children</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Every man would love the opportunity to date women who don&#39;t have kids. If nothing else, it&#39;san inconvenience to s chedule dates with women who have kids, considering the fact thesewomen have to find a babysitter if their children are underage. If they&#39;re older kids, the woman might be involved in a lot of extracurricular school activities. Also, th ere&#39;s always the possibility the woman might be struggling if the kids&#39; father isn&#39;t helping much financially. If this is the case, the woman could be looking for a beta-male provider to help her out financially with her kids. Oh, and let&#39;s not forget thepsychotic baby fathers out there who are still obsessed with their baby mothers. These arealways draw backs to dating women with children, but you&#39;re going to be missing out on a lot of good women if you try to exclud e women with kids from your dating options. See, the fact of the matter is that the reason there are so many women who are unhappily single is they exclude a lot of men from their dating options. You have women who only want m en who are over six feet tall, have six-pack abs, and make six figures a year, and then are baffled as to why they&#39;re si ngle. I&#39;m all for everyone having standards, but some people get carried away with their standards. A man should not date an unemployed single mother with eight kids cohabitating with her babies&#39; father-we can agree on that. Howev er, I see nothing wrong with dating a single mother with two kids from a previous marriage who just so happens to b e a lawyer with her own house. There is an upsideto dating women with kids too. In my experience, they tend to nev er be needy because they are preoccupied with their kids in some kind of capacity or another. This might not work f or men with no purpose in life, as they tend to have a lot of available time and prefer to spend that available time wit</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">h women. One thing to keep in mind is that you can&#39;t be needy if you&#39;re going to date women with kids. Making a w oman choose between you and her kids is the quickest way to find yourself on the outside looking in. Although I see nothing wrong with dating successful women with kids, for purple- pill men who are aware of the female nature but prefer relationships over dating multiplewomen, I would advise them against getting into relationships with women who have kids. This is the whole alpha-fucks, beta-bucks dynamic. The alpha-fucks, beta-bucks dynamic is when a woman has fun with the alpha male in her prime years only to settle for the beta to help raise the alpha&#39;s kids later on</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">. I strongly disagree with men raising other men&#39;s kids. My advice is to date them but never wife them. If you&#39;re a pu rple-pill guy and want the whole family dynamic, then I suggest you date women with kids, but only get into a relati onship with women who don&#39;t have kids.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 41</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Female Nature Misconceptions</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most men in the manosphere who are red-pill aware already know the ugly side to the femalenature, such as hyperga my, chasing the alpha when they&#39;re young only to settle with the beta when they&#39;re older, and cheating on the beta wi th an alpha to replicate the alpha. Although this is primarily true, there are always loopholes in everything. I firmly b elieve in hypergamy, but I&#39;ve seen situations where a woman would get hit on by men who have more money than th e guy she was with does only to stay with the guyshe was with. If it was only about the money, then why would she choose to stay with the guy who had less money? The answer is simple: confidence. Most men who have a veryattra ctive woman usually start to get jealous and insecure when they know their girl gets a lot of attention, which in turn makes the guy start to lose his swagger once he develops anattachment. Some men, however, don&#39;t develop this inse curity, despite knowing their girl could attract a more financially successful man because, despite not having all the f inancial success of other men, he&#39;s confident in what he does have, which is his sex appeal. Let&#39;s not forget, now, tha t sex appeal is subjective. In other words, you have sex appeal if you believe you have sex appeal. There are some m en who have six-pack abs, nice clothes, and a smooth voice and still lack sex appeal due to their lack of confidence, which is the cornerstone of sexappeal. So it&#39;s not a look that gives you sex appeal; it&#39;s a mindset that gives you sex a ppeal.Most men believe that due to the female nature, if they lose their job, their woman is going to leave them. Let&#39; s be honest here; if you lose yourjob and throw a pity party for yourself over the next six months, then, yes, your wo man is going to leave you, but if you&#39;re the type of guy who doesn&#39;t lose his confidence and gets right back on the ho rse, I firmly believe a woman would stick it out as long as you made a relativelyquick recovery. I also want to point out that this info is for alpha male - minded guys, as a beta male lacks the mindset needed to maintain the masculine frame during hardships. Men who perceive themselves as beta males primarily relyon their financial success to attra ct women; therefore, it&#39;s virtually impossible for a man with a beta-male mindset to maintain any semblance of attra ction during a hardship. Hisconfidence is tied to his financial success. A woman really doesn&#39;t care about a beta mal eanyway other than about what he can provide, so it&#39;s easy to see why women would leave thesemen during hardshi p, but if you read my first book, Alpha Male Strategies: Dating in the Social Media Age, then you should havedevel oped the mindset of a high-value man. Therefore, that shouldn&#39;t be an issue for you. Ifyou&#39;re a high-value male with an abundance mindset, then you should know women don&#39;tleave because you lost your job; they leave because you l ost your confidence and swagger.Another big misconception is that all women cheat. While I do think it&#39;s possible f or any woman to cheat, I wholeheartedly believe thatas long as a man is maintaining frame and keeping the sexual p assion in the relationship, a woman won&#39;t cheat. That being said, most men don&#39;t maintain frame and sexual passion t hroughout a monogamous relationship. Most men get complacent and lazy during a relationship. A lot of men bring their A game during courtship but bring their D game during a relationship. Women get bored easily, and even if the ir fond of the person you are, it might be worthwhile for you to try something new sexually from time to time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most men can withstand a woman&#39;s test during the courtship only to fail it once they&#39;ve developed an attachment. Th is weakening behavior will cause a woman to seek pleasure from a moredominant man. To be fair, while I think any woman is capab le of cheating, some women do have integrity and would rather end things than cheat on you. Whet her she cheats or leaves boils down to a couple of scenarios. If she&#39;s with you because she perceives you as a beta m ale and as a good provider, but she lacks integrity, then she&#39;ll cheat. If she&#39;s with you because she perceives you as a n alpha male, but you lost your swagger and the relationship lost its passion, then she&#39;ll leave because your swagger was the only reason she was with you. If a woman is with you because she deemed you to be an alpha male, then yo u have no value to her if you lose your swagger; therefore, there is no reason to cheat. She might as well leave the re lationship. If a woman is with you because she perceives you as a beta male, then she is always susceptible to cheati</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ng because, often, she isn&#39;t even attracted to you sexually but rather to whatyou can provide financially. Remember, attraction isn&#39;t just looks; it&#39;s your whole being as a man. If a woman perceives you as an alpha male, and you mainta in your swagger throughout the relationship, I wholeheartedly doubt she would cheat on you because she&#39;ll be too bu sy chasing your validation to cheat.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 42</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let Her Come Back to You</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There&#39;s going to come a time in every long-term relationship when there&#39;s either going to be a separation or a comple te breakup altogether. If this is a woman you&#39;re tired of, then this won&#39;t be an issue for you, but when it&#39;s a woman y ou still care for tremendously, it can be heart-wrenching. Your masculinity as a man will get tested.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You&#39;re going to have some sleepless nights when you wonder if she has met another guy or, even worse if she&#39;s slee ping, with another guy. As a man, you can&#39;t control what she&#39;s doing during a breakup, but what you can control is w hat you&#39;re doing during a breakup. First off, you have to have the mindset that she&#39;s gone and never coming back. Y ou definitely can&#39;t call her first, as that would either cause her to lose all attraction due to your lack of strength or giv e her permission to emasculate you. Women expect men to have more strength than they do. She can know you&#39;re hu rting, but it&#39;s something different when she knows you don&#39;t have enough strength as a man, not to cave.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On TV, you see men coming back to their ex with flowers, and the woman starts crying, and they live happily ever a fter. In actuality, this is not how it works because women do the choosing. You can&#39;t ask a woman for a relationship before she brings it to you, and you can&#39;t be the first one to try to reconcile the relationship after a breakup. When yo u do, you make women uncomfortable because their feelings aren&#39;t there yet. A man who wants a relationship more t han a woman does is not a high-value male. High-value men want to date and stay single as long as they possibly ca n before the woman starts to ask, &quot;Where is this going?&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re a purple-pill guy interested in marriage someday, you shouldn&#39;t even consider asking the woman until she&#39;s throwing hints about marriage or flat-out asking, &quot;What are we doing?&quot; If you don&#39;t wait to hear that, the woman mi ght agree to marry you out of obligation only to divorce you a couple years later because she never loved you to begi n with.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Women subconsciously progress the relationship at their own pace. If you&#39;re a guy who wants to progress the relatio nship, then try improving to become a high-value male to create feelings within the woman so that she wants to prog ress things. A man progressing things causes women to pull back or lose interest altogether.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 43</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women Treat Every Man Differently</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You say &quot;needy&quot;; I say &quot;high interest.&quot; Once you become a high-value man with options, you better get used to wom en pursuing you heavily. This could come across as them being needy, but that would imply that she does this with e very man she meets. That is the furthest thing from the truth. What I&#39;ve learned from dealing with women in my life is that women act differently with different men. That same woman you&#39;re calling needy probably has ten other guys who&#39;ve been trying to get a date with her for God knows how long. That same woman who gave it up to you the firs t night has twenty other guys who can&#39;t even get a callback.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Men are so used to difficult women that they automatically assume a woman is easy if she sleeps with them soon aft er meeting. As you become a high-value man, you should start to demand this, as you&#39;re no longer going to wait thre e months to have sex with women. With that being said, some women are needy, and some women are slutty in the world, meaning they do act this way with every man they meet. Although there are these types of women in the worl d, as a high - value man, you should think it&#39;s you, and not her, first, but there is a way to tell if it&#39;s you or just her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Women have been taught that men pursue, and even if she likes you a lot, she won&#39;t over pursue in the beginning. A woman who&#39;s double texting or calling right from the jump is needy. It&#39;s virtually impossible to get a woman&#39;s intere st that high initially, as women don&#39;t put as much emphasis on looks as men do. It usually takes a man&#39;s personality t</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">o raise a woman&#39;s interest high enough to where she&#39;s doing most of the pursuing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Women naturally try to screen out weak men by testing them to avoid sleeping with them. A woman can test you thr oughout a night out, and it is even possible if she came over to your place, because she could&#39;ve tested you on the ini tial meeting or phone call. Only a complete slut would sleep with a man without testing his strength. If you were abl e to sleep with a woman without her testing you, then I guess it&#39;s safe to say she does that quite often. The only reaso n this should matter to you is if you&#39;re considering something long term with the woman. I see nothing wrong with a promiscuous woman, but we have a saying where I&#39;m from: &quot;Don&#39;t try to change a whore to a housewife.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The reasoning for this is simple: when a woman shows a man that she&#39;s not a challenge, then he instantly knows he c ould never trust her fully. Whether you can change a whore to a housewife is debatable, but what can&#39;t be debated is that a man must be able to trust a woman, or the relationship is done, even if it&#39;s just the man&#39;s insecurity that causes the breakup.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Chapter 44</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">What to Expect Once You Get into a Relationship</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re a purple-pill guy, and you get into a relationship with a woman, it&#39;s commonplace tosee a change in the wo man&#39;s behavior in the same way a lot of men stop dating their woman or lose their masculine frame in a relationship. If you&#39;re a high-value male, and a woman perceives you as an alpha, then you can expect her to go all out to lure yo u into a relationship. This could include, but is not limited to, her cooking, being very feminine, and being very sexu al in the bedroom. If a woman perceives you as a beta male, more than likely you had to convince her you were a go od provider, and she did very little to win you over. In other words, women win over men they perceive as alpha mal es, but men who women perceive as beta males have to win women over. This is just another reason a man shouldn&#39;t get into a relationship with women who perceive him as a beta male. When a woman is actively seeking a beta-male provider, she might do some of the same things mentioned as she would for a man she perceives as an alpha in the s hort term to secure a relationship. If she has bigger aspirations, she might stay on her best behavior a little longer to secure marriage. The difference is when a woman is dating a man she perceives as an alpha male; as long as he main tains his swagger and masculine frame throughout therelationship, the woman never gets comfortable enough to stop doing what she initially did inthe beginning because he knows how to keep her in a scarcity mindset. When a woma n isdating a man she perceives as a beta, he&#39;s typically the one in the scarcity mindset due to the lack of affection a w oman gives a man she perceives as a beta male. This lack of affection causes the man who the woman perceives as a beta male to always feel a sense of uncertainty. This allows the woman to control the relationship, and instead of he r trying to keep him happy, he&#39;s trying to keep her happy. There&#39;s a couple of reasons women stop the special treatm ent once they get into a relationship with men they perceive as alpha males. For one, she knows she&#39;s your only sour ce of sex if you&#39;re being monogamous. So this will be the equivalent of her trying to manipulate the relationship. Thi s gives thewoman tremendous leverage in the relationship. There&#39;s a myth that&#39;s floating around that says women lov e sex just as much as men. Anybody who knows anything about human sexuality knows this is a complete farce. Me n have about eight times the amount of testosterone as women do. Testosterone is the main driver behind sexual desi re. Women love sex, and that&#39;s a fact, but men would have sex 24/7 if they were given the chance. Relationships are about leverage, and whoever has the leverage controls the relationship. Unfortunately, women control most relations hips due to this simple fact. Typical behavior you can expect is for her to not want sex as much as she once did as sh e &quot;tries&quot; to manipulate the relationship. If you&#39;re on your best behavior like a good boy, she&#39;ll give you a cookie. Thi s good behavior is by lettingher have her way. So if she has the power, how are you to get it back? The answer is si mple: it&#39;s the same as what happens to your job if you stopped performing at work. You would get fired. Even if a w oman isn&#39;t, let&#39;s say, being a bitch, a woman not doing what she did to get you is grounds for termination in my book</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">. You can expect your woman to lose interest if you stop dating her, and a woman should expect you to want out if s he&#39;s not doing what she previously did in the relationship. As a man, you have to let women know there&#39;s no lifetime achievement award; if she&#39;s not doing what she did previously in the relationship, you have to let her know that&#39;s no t what you signed up for. Another reason you can expect women to not do what they did previously prior to the com mitment is that giving a woman a relationship could be a sign to her that you&#39;re catching feelings. When you do anyt hing that might be a sign that you&#39;re catching feelings, women naturally start to test boundaries. As a man, whenever you are tested by a woman in the slightest way, you have to always let her know anything less than complete compl iance will not be tolerated.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 45</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Do I Decide Who Gets the Top Spot?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: -5pt;text-align: center;">Looks are very important to men and, upon initial approach, are usually the most important thing. When it comes to the women I&#39;m currently dating, however, looks are no longer the determining factor, mainly because I don&#39;t date wo men below an eight in my eyes. I say &quot;in my eyes&quot; because looks are subjective. A dime to me might be a six to you. This is the samereason I theorize there is no universally alpha or beta male. When it comes to the women I&#39;m dating</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">, or what I like to call my rotation, compatibility is the most important thing in determining who gets the top spot. T he top spot is usually Saturday night, as it&#39;s the night with the most couple activities and is schedule friendly, as mos t people work during the week. Personality is important, as it&#39;s always nice to hang out with a nice, feminine woman with high interest. The issue I have with trying to use personality as a determining factor as to who gets the top spot is if you don&#39;t have much in the way of compatibility, it can get pretty boring at times. When you&#39;re out with a woma n who you are not compatible with but find highly attractive, and she has all the sweet, feminine qualities you want, sometimes it&#39;s hard to keep the conversation going. Maybe you&#39;re into sports, and she&#39;s into soap operas, but for wha tever reason, due to a lack of compatibility,the relationship seems dull outside the bedroom. I&#39;m not opposed to datin g women I&#39;m less compatible with, as I&#39;m not looking for marriage, but when it comes to the top spot in my rotation, it has to be someone I can have an interesting conversation with. Looks are not even in the equation, as I would alw ays rather spend more time with a woman I view as an eight and whom I am very compatible than spend time with a woman I view as a dime and am less compatible with. Don&#39;t confuse this with dating a woman I perceive as a 5 wit h compatibility. In that case, I would much rather date the dime and with less compatibility. You can&#39;t have sex 24/7</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">; you have to talk to one another eventually. Looks, however, are always the most important thing when it comes to t he quality of women I approach.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 46</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s All a Matter of Preferences</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some men are miffed at the notion that despite having their lives in order or having their stuff together, they still get rejected. Other men are miffed at the notion that despite being in great shape physically, they still get rejected. Well, besides the fact that looks are subjective, different women value different attributes in men. Some women are more turned on by a man with his life in order than they are by looks. These women could be looking for a beta-male prov ider or could just want a man who can bringwhat she brings to the table. A woman who makes $100,000 a year coul d just want a manwho could meet her halfway. I can remember when I lived in a Brooklyn basement, and let me tell you, some women would run for the hills&#39; while others didn&#39;t mind. The reason for that was the women who didn&#39;t m ind their physical attraction for me overpowered their hypergamous nature. Allwomen have different ideas about wh at&#39;s important to them, just like a man has different levels of what&#39;s important to him when it comes down to looks, p ersonality, and responsibility. Some men will value a woman&#39;s looks, despite her being the biggest bitch this world h as ever seen. I, however, value looks, but it won&#39;t matter how attractive you are if I don&#39;t like your personality or fin d you very irresponsible - like you purchase clothes when you&#39;re behind on your light bill. I can honestly say living i n that basement cost me a lot of women, so I advise men to try to be the best version of themselves to give themselv es the best chance to attract the most women they possible can. You&#39;re still going to get rejections, as everything in d ating is subjective. What it means to have your life in order to one woman might not be the same for another woman</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">. For instance, the woman at your gym might be impressed that you have a steady job, your own place, and reliable t ransportation. Nicole Murphy, however, who&#39;s been married to and dated multiple rich celebrities, might not be so i mpressed. What one woman might think is charming might be corny to another woman. The difference between bei ng corny and charming can be something as simple as awoman&#39;s physical attraction level. When a woman has a high physical attraction level, everything you do and say within reason can be deemed to be charming. Looks aside, som e women just have a different classification for what&#39;s charming. Some women prefer the smooth, laid-back, confide nt approach, while others prefer a more upbeat, jovial man. At the end of the day, it&#39;s all a numbers game, and the m ore of a social life you live, the better chance you have at attracting the quality of women you want. The reason I pre fer to say you should live a social life as opposed to casually approaching women at random is the latter puts you in a position where your happiness depends on how many women you can attract, while the former suggests you just li ve a life of social abundance, and through the law of attraction, everything just happens naturally.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 47</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women You Should Not Date</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">My niche in the dating community is mostly centered around raising a woman&#39;s interestlevel. I think it&#39;s also very im portant for men to have standards and not to simply date allwomen. It should always scare a man when a woman is p ushing for a relationship from the start. I know a lot of men don&#39;t want to hear this, but women are the choosers. A w oman should always have more options than a man does, unless the man is an A-list celebrity. Women are taught a man should prove his worth to them before they engage in sexual activity or a relationship with him. By proving you rself, I&#39;m referring to passing her test, which tests your sexual market value. Men with options naturally pass the test due to having options, while men who don&#39;t have options fail women&#39;s tests. If the woman is looking for a provider, then she wants to see how good of a provider you are. She can determine this through the courting phase by how mu ch money you spend on restaurants, trips, and so on.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With women having so many options, it naturally makes them more selective. If a woman is pushing for a relationsh ip from the start, it is a sign she doesn&#39;t have many options. Women who sleep with men without testing them are slu ts. I call them this because they put no value on their bodies. I have no issue with a woman being as promiscuous as a man, but for God&#39;s sake, at least check to see if he has alpha characteristics. Women who want relationships witho ut first weighing all of their options are women without options. Maybe a woman has sexual options, but not many men want anything else from her. This is a telltale sign of a woman with character flaws, because women with a lot of redeeming qualities usually have multiple men vying for their attention - and not just their sexual attention. Wom en without options are usually the women who bring nothing to the table but sex but are confused as to why men do n&#39;t want anything from them but sex.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re a guy and thinking to yourself, &quot;Hey, I don&#39;t have anything to prove to women,&quot; that attitude is actually pro ving yourself to women because you don&#39;t think you have anything to prove to women. The guy who brags about his finances, cars, and vacations is the guy who actually fails because he&#39;s trying to prove himself to women. The guy w ho doesn&#39;t try to prove himself is the guy who actually is proving himself by having the mindset of &quot;Either I&#39;m good enough, or I&#39;m not.&quot; That shows an abundance mindset, which shows options and a higher sexual market value. If a woman doesn&#39;t have options, then it must be for a reason, assuming she&#39;s on point physically.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women who are pushing for relationships from the start show they have a scarcity mindset. A woman usually has m ultiple suitors unless they&#39;re morbidly obese, and even some of those women have options, as seen on My 600lb Life</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">. So if a woman doesn&#39;t have options, then you have to ask yourself why. I know you&#39;re probably thinking, &quot;Hey, wh at if it&#39;s just high interest?&quot; Good point, but I would counter that with the fact that initial high interest might make a woman want to jump in the sack with you, but getting into a monogamous relationship is something entirely differen</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">t. Usually the reason a woman is pushing for a relationship from the get-go is that she has a bad reputation or is emot ionally damaged. By &quot;bad reputation,&quot; I&#39;m referring to her promiscuous way of getting around. Nobody wants to wif e the town whore. Typically, these women seek men who may not be familiar with their promiscuous ways. When I&#39; m referencing being emotionally damaged, I&#39;m referring to women who may have been hurt in the past or are lonely.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women who&#39;s been hurt in the past may have trust issues or baggage. When a woman is trying to recover from a guy she might&#39;ve developed an attachment to, but he doesn&#39;t want her, she&#39;l l try to find a rebound to keep her mind occu pied. If you find yourself with a woman who&#39;s using you as a rebound,you always run the possibility of her hurting y ou if you get attached to her. I&#39;ve had this happen several years ago when a woman got back with her ex. A woman will always retreat back to her ex when he wants her back if the attachment is still there. Your feelings won&#39;t matter. I think it&#39;s fair to say that most adults may have had their hearts broken at some point or another, but some carry this baggage longer than others. This baggage could lead to low self-esteem. A woman who still has trust and self-estee m issues will ultimately have a hard time trusting you, and vice versa. It&#39;s not your job to fix people. You1l never be able to give this type of woman enough validation to make her feel better about herself. You should strive to date wo men who are emotionally stable and happy and are not carrying emotional baggage.You should not date women who constantly complain about a lack of communication. The reason I used the word &quot;constantly&quot; is that as a high-value man, you should expect to hear the occasional &quot;Why do you never call me?&quot; That&#39;s fine - and actually a good thing - as it shows the woman actually cares. It also shows you&#39;re providing the emotional turmoil women need to maintain</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">their attraction to you. Hearing it every week or multiple times a week is something totally different. The issue with this is it starts to interfere with your purpose in life. Instead of focusing on your goals in life, you&#39;ll be focused on w hether you called her enough that day.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s not even the bad part; the bad part is that no matter how much you communicate, it&#39;s never enough. This is w hy it&#39;s so important as a high-value man to date women on your same wavelength. Women who have goals and purp ose in life are too preoccupied with their careers to worry about how much a man is calling them. I&#39;m all for high-int erest women, as they typically make things easy for the man, but some women cross the line and go straight into the needy category. A needy woman is almost as difficult to date as a woman with lower interest. At least the low- inter est woman doesn&#39;t get on your nerves; she&#39;s just not interested.Most women with children prefer not to introduce me n to their children unti l they feel like the relationship is going somewhere. However, you may encounter women wh o try to introduce you to their children fairly quickly.You should never try to date these women.The reason for this i s that they&#39;re trying to make you a step daddy within the first couple of weeks of dating. Some of these women even have the audacity to want to bring their children on the date. I feel like dating should be ab out getting to know the w oman first, and if things go well, then maybe later you could meet her kids. Some women &#39;s rationale behind introdu cing a man quickly to their kids is that they don&#39;t want to invest much time into a man who doesn&#39;t click with their c hildren. I would counter that argument with the fact that no man should want a woman who is actively looking for a relationship and vice versa.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A person who is looking for a relationship is a person who isn&#39;t complete single and therefore is actively seeking so meone to complete them. The type of people who look for love are typically the type of people who depend on you t oo much emotionally and time-wise. You should strive to date women who have a complete life made of friends, ho bbies, and activities outside of you. These types of women tend to be better to date since they&#39;re already happy in the ir lives and not looking for someone to complete them. My advice, if you meet these types of women, is to maybe ha ve fun for a little while, but I wouldn&#39;t ever consider putting them in my rotation. Maya Angelou had a great phrase: &quot;when people show you who they are, believe them.&quot; If you&#39;re a regular on the dating scene, you may run into some sarcastic women from time to time. A sarcastic woman may throw the occasional jabs your way via an insult or offe nsive statement. When you check her on it, she may give you the sarcastic laugh and the sarcastic woman&#39;s national anthem: &quot;Why are you so serious? I&#39;m just playing with you.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If you decide to date this woman, her little insults and offensive statements will only get worse. After a while, you w on&#39;t know when she&#39;s serious or just joking, but the thing is, she&#39;s always serious. A masculine frame doesn&#39;t stop the se women, as they just have that smart, little mouth that always seems to have something sassy to say. A woman like this is technically gaslighting you, as you&#39;ll appear too sensitive when you check her on her sassy mouth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You may start to question yourself as to whether you are too sensitive. Dating individuals who try to make you quest ion your emotional well-being is never a good idea. Another type of woman every man should try to avoid is the mat erialistic woman. They&#39;re typically easy to spot because when you announce the date location, they usually have a re buttal. I teach men to keep dates cheap, at least initially, to keep your investment down because there are no guarant ees the two of you will even like each other. This won&#39;t work for materialistic women. Trust me when I say they&#39;ll co nveniently always have a better spot in mind. From my experience, it does no good trying to go along with things in the hope of getting sex, as high-maintenance women typically make you work extremely hard to &quot;earn&quot; sex with the m, and by &quot;earn,&quot; I&#39;m referring to spending money. A materialistic woman could find you attractive sexually, like yo ur personality, and still not want to date you if you can&#39;t meet her requirements as far as providing. A woman who fe els entitled to a fancy dinner on a first date is not the type of woman you want to date. It&#39;ll only be the beginning.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 48</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dating is for Betas</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This might come as a surprise to a lot of my followers, but I enjoy going on dates with women. Whether you enjoy g oing on dates is all a matter of perception. If you perceive a date as only a means to get sex from women, then natura lly you&#39;re going to hate the aspect of taking women on dates. This is the same reason a lot of men hate going to clubs</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">. Instead of enjoying themselves, they see the club just as a means to meet women. If you think like I do, which is th at the date is about me and not the woman, then you&#39;ll love taking women on dates.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When I decide what I want to do Saturday evening after a long, hard week of grinding, I&#39;m only concerned with wha t I want to do or where I want to eat. I&#39;m only inviting a woman out as my company; if it&#39;s something she&#39;s not partic ularly fond of, then I don&#39;t all of a sudden change my plans for her. If you let the woman change your plans, then yo u&#39;re making the data about her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It shows the woman you&#39;re willing to do anything to spend time with her, which is a turnoff - unless she perceives y ou as a beta-male provider. If that&#39;s how she views you, then she expects you to change your plans. If I&#39;m in that situ ation, I would either invite someone else or go alone. If any of you guys are wondering why I wouldn&#39;t just invite a g uy friend out, if you&#39;ve been following me for a while now, you would know that I&#39;m not particularly fond of male c ompanionship.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The reason I&#39;m not fond of male companionship is quite simple: for all women&#39;s flaws, I would still rather hang with women over men any day of the week. I&#39;m well aware that women can be hypergamous, emotional, and deceitful - a nd the list goes on - but I would much rather deal with women and their ways than men and their jealousy. If you ha ve male friends, the biggest obstacle is avoiding jealousy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If both of you are losers or are fairly successful, there might not be much jealousy between you, but it is rare for two friends to be on the same wavelength. There&#39;s usually someone in the group doing better than the others, which in tu rn causes some kind of jealousy. A lot of individuals ignore jealous behavior from friends, but I simply can&#39;t do that.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It doesn&#39;t even have to be monetary jealousy; it could be something as simple as one friend attracts more women tha n the other or sleeps with hotter chicks than the other. This has been my experience throughout my life when dealing with male companionship. If you&#39;re one of the lucky ones who have a supportive male cast, then consider yourself l ucky and cherish those friendships, as I can speak from experience that they don&#39;t happen often. Some men have cra ppy friends but tolerate the jealousy because they rationalize that it&#39;s better than having no friends at all.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These are the same guys, however, who also rationalize that it&#39;s better to keep an uncooperative female than to be al one. If you have a fear of being alone, then you&#39;re going to always have people in your life that disrespect you becau se you have no boundaries. Changing my plans to accommodate a woman would then mean the date is about her and not me. If I&#39;m paying, then I&#39;m going to go where I want to go. If the woman wants the date to be about her, then sh e should invite me out to where she wants to go. There are a couple of other reasons a lot of men don&#39;t enjoy dates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First, they date women with very low interest, hoping to raise their interest throughout the date; instead of trying to e njoy themselves on the date, they&#39;re fixated on their goal, which is to have sex. I advise men to talk on the phone wit h a woman first before going on a date to make sure she has adequate interest; a woman with less than average intere st will sound very bored on the phone. In other words, the conversation will feel more like an interview than a mutua l conversation. If she sounds bored on the phone, then what makes you think she&#39;s going to all of a sudden be enthus ed on the date? When you&#39;re out with women who have a genuine interest, dates are very fun to be on. A feminine w oman makes the date easy, and it doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re on a job interview. Remember, a woman&#39;s feminine energy comes from her interest and attraction level. Another pitfall that men fall into is focusing too much on the end game instead of being present during the date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Being present means you&#39;re trying to get to know her and not just there to get sex. While I might be against monoga mous relationships, I like women. The reason a lot of men don&#39;t like women in that they spend too much time chasin g women with low interest or women who are attention whores. Women who like you, which creates feminine energ y, are very fun to be around.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Another reason some men hate women is they hate the aspect of women having the power to choose. A lot of men h ate the fact that women will always have more options than men do. Even if the woman makes minimum wage and i s slightly overweight, she&#39;ll have more options than a multimillionaire with a six-pack. The reason women will alwa ys have more options than men do has more to do with men than it does with women. Men by and large will sleep w ith anything that moves as long as she looks halfway decent. Women, however, typically have some standards. Even</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the town slut will only sleep with men she finds very desirable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Men have very low standards as to whom they would sleep with, and this gives the women more options. A lot of m en hate to come to grips with this aspect of sexual relations between men and women. This inability to deal with real ity often causes some men to hate women. These low standards are often why the average woman will always have more of an abundance mindset than the average man does. Also, I&#39;m not against going out to eat alone. My rationaliz ation is, why would I go out alone when I have women whom I&#39;m interested in I could take out? If I don&#39;t have a part icular woman I&#39;m interested in, then by no means am I afraid to go to dinner by myself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 49</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You&#39;re Going to Die Old and Lonely</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re a heterosexual man who chooses to live a bachelor&#39;s lifestyle, then I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard the phrase &quot;You&#39;re going to die old and lonely&quot; at least once in your life. AI; a man, you can expect to be shamed when you don&#39;t confo rm to society&#39;s social programming. Anytime you think for yourself as opposed to living like a sheep and following t he herd; you should expect to be shamed. Women are master manipulators, and when something doesn&#39;t benefit the m, they resort to shaming tactics. The funny thing is, men who&#39;ve bought into this way of thinking will also shame y ou.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You should expect more shaming tactics from men than from women if you&#39;re a red-pill man. I think this comes fro m jealousy within those men. When a man is single and free to do as he pleases, I think men who are in relationships deep down envy this type of man. They wish they could live a life of freedom without feeling lonely, and by freedo m, I&#39;m referring to the ability to make all your choices on your own. Any man who&#39;s in a relationship can attest to th e fact that although he may be an adult, once you&#39;re in a committed relationship, especially if you&#39;re married or livin g together, you no longer make decisions on your own. You have to weigh your woman&#39;s opinion too.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re a man who&#39;s thinking about quitting your job to pursue your passion in life, you can&#39; t do that without talkin g it over with your girlfriend or wife. You can try to make decisions of this nature on your own, but it can lead to a l ot of cold nights if you get what I&#39;m saying. When you&#39;re single and not into monogamous relationships, you can ma ke life-altering decisions void of anyone&#39;s opinions. This is why I think men who need relationships develop jealous y toward men who don&#39;t. That was not a mistake when I used the word &quot;need.&quot; Some men need a relationship becaus e they can&#39;t stand the thought of being alone. As a man who doesn&#39;t conform to society&#39;s standards, you may hear thi s from beta males. The reason I refer to them as beta males is that alpha males don&#39;t capitulate to the masses. Alpha males do their own thing and don&#39;t let others influence them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Living a bachelor&#39;s lifestyle doesn&#39;t automatically make you an alpha male, because there are a lot of married alpha males; being your own man does. You can be married or in a monogamous relationship and still be considered an al pha male, but it has to be something that you wanted to do and not something a woman gave you an ultimatum to do or because you wanted to keep her from seeing other men. This is why I commonly refer to men who cheat in mono gamous relationships as the &quot;world&#39;s biggest cockblockers.&quot; Men who cheat in monogamous relationships are the wo rld&#39;s biggest simps. I say this because they didn&#39;t get into a monogamous relationship because it&#39;s something they wa nted to do but rather to prevent the woman from sleeping with other men simply. There are a couple of reasons that women and beta males shame men who choose to live a bachelor lifestyle. The women do it because it doesn&#39;t benef it them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The female narrative is to have fun with men they perceive as alpha males in their prime years only to settle down w ith men they perceive as beta males once the women have matured and are ready to start a family, assuming they are unable to find an all-around alpha male to settle down with. Maybe a woman has a kid or two by a man she perceive d as alpha and now wants a man she perceives as a beta male to pick up the tab. Men either wander in their early yea rs trying to get laid as much as possible or build their careers. Some men can actually accomplish these tasks simulta neously, but usually, you have to pick one or the other. Men who spent their early years chasing women are usually t he ones who later in life apply to the saying, &quot;You&#39;re going to die old and lonely.&quot; Let me explain. If you spend your early years pursuing women instead of focusing on building yourself up, you&#39;re not going to have much value once you reach forty years of age. By that point, you&#39;re usually not attractive enough to attract the younger women as you</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">once were, and the women your age are more about stability by that point.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In that case, yes, you very well may die old and lonely because your sexual market value is very low since you&#39;re not as attractive as you once were and don&#39;t have the finances that women who are ready to settle down are looking for. These men still have their charisma and swagger, but I think it&#39;s fair to say that an older man with limited finances m ight not have the same confidence level that he once did. That&#39;s only human nature, as I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible for a forty-year-old woman to have the same confidence she once did. Let&#39;s be honest for a second; a lot of your confiden ce comes from external validation. People can try to deny this, but it&#39;s the truth. If your tum a lot of heads when you walk down the street, then I think it&#39;s fair to say your confidence is going to be a little higher than someone who doe sn&#39;t.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Of course, it&#39;s always better if your confidence comes from internal sources rather than external ones, but this just is n&#39;t always the case. I know there are always going to be outliers, and there are some guys who are able to maintain t heir sex appeal well into their forties and beyond. But you shouldn&#39;t count on this being the norm.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Additionally, some older women might not care if you&#39;re not exactly swimming in money in your forties, but the nu mber of women who consider you to be a viable option greatly decreases in that situation, so you do run the risk of d ying old and lonely. I must also bring up the fact that you could get married to a woman and then get a divorce, leavi ng you destitute anyway. However, if you spent your early years chasing success, you shouldn&#39;t have this issue as lo ng as you developed the right mindset along the way. A man with his life in order in his later years not only makes h imself viable to younger women, as seen with Hugh Hefner but also makes himself viable to older women looking f or stability.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;m not opposed to dating women who view you as a beta-male provider; I&#39;m just opposed to getting into a monoga mous relationship with women who view you as a beta-male provider. Quite frankly, I wouldn&#39;t even put a woman who views me as a beta-male provider in my rotation. A man who has his life in order should naturally be confident based on the number of options he has, but some men lack this confidence due to a lack of socializing that typically happens in a person&#39;s later years. As we age, we usually become homebodies. If you&#39;re a man who has his life in ord er and can manage to maintain an active social life, you shouldn&#39;t have an issue maintaining the confidence needed t o give you the swagger to attract women even in your elderly state. Remember, success, coupled with an active soci al life, prevents scarcity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 50</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Location, Location, Location</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Something that is often overlooked is your location. You can be following your purpose all you want, but if you live in a slow city or town with what seems like five women in it, it&#39;s straightforward to fall into a scarcity mindset. This lack of activity can make you feel like you&#39;re compelled to stay in a toxic relationship or overpursue a woman you&#39;r e dating. Whenever a man isn&#39;t living with a mindset of abundance, bad things start happening.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An abundance mindset will not only improve your social life but also enhance your career, as more often than not, a more vibrant city has more career opportunities. You have to live in a place that has places to socialize. I&#39;m from a s mall town myself, so I know firsthand the challenges facing a man in this situation. If you live in a small, boring tow n with limited options, my advice to you would be to start planning your escape. Maybe this takes a year or two to a ccomplish, but I would start working on this immediately. Living in a small town with nothing to do can make you f eel lonely. There&#39;s only so much time you can give to your purpose before you need a mental break. How are you su pposed to live an active social life if there&#39;s nothing to do?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">A lot of men are going to read this and think to themselves, &quot;My career is here,&quot; but I would counter that statement b y saying that&#39;s not the only job you can get. What I learned about human beings in my nearly forty years on this eart h is that most people would rather complain about something than come up with solutions. Another thing I&#39;ve learne d is that nothing fixes itself; you have to fix the situation. So either you can stay where your job is and be isolated, or you can move, find another job, and live a social life of abundance. I can&#39;t speak for everybody, but I was miserable at times living in a small town with limited things to do. Of course, you could travel to the nearest big city, but I wo</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">uld then ask, why not just move there instead?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whatever you&#39;re saving on rent by living farther away from the city would surely be negated by driving back and for th anyway. As a high-value man, time is your biggest asset, not money. High-value men buy time, while low-value men sell time. What I mean by this is that people with a high-value mindset have figured out that it&#39;s better to pay a l ittle more for rent and spend more time working than to spend that time they otherwise would commuting two hours a day because they live farther away from the city. If instead of spending two hours a day five days a week commuti ng, you spent that time working, you&#39;ve more then made up for the extra price in rent. Your location also matters in t hat it gets women comfortable. You can have as much game and confidence as you want, but if you can&#39;t make a wo man feel comfortable, then nothing will happen sexually.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;m not saying you have to live at the Ritz-Carlton to make a woman feel comfortable, but you can&#39;t live in a doghou se either. I&#39;m not talking about how nice your crib is, although that helps, I&#39;m referring to a woman needing privacy and the assurance of safety. As with most things regarding dating, some women won&#39;t mind if you live in a house ful l of relatives or roommates, while some will.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I will say this, though: you undoubtedly will be leaving a lot of women on the table if you don&#39;t live alone. Some wo men feel insecure about everyday human activities, such as using the restroom or having sex, while friends and relati ves are in the next room. Some women can&#39;t get in the mood with other individuals, particularly adults, in the next ro om. What if they hear her for God&#39;s sake? My advice to men has always been and will continue to be to focus on im proving your living situation first; therefore, when you do attract women, it will be easier to seal the deal. In my opi nion, the last thing a man who doesn&#39;t have his place should be focusing on is dating. If this is you, then your prioriti es are all out of whack. It&#39;s better to pay a little more for rent and spend more time working than to spend that time t hey otherwise would commuting two hours a day because they live farther away from the city.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If instead of spending two hours a day five days a week commuting, you spent that time working, you&#39;ve more than made up for the extra price in rent.

If a woman is chasing you, it does give you t his feeling of superiority and attractiveness. It&#39;s also a great indicator of interest in most cases; after all, you could ju st be dealing with a lunatic who gets too attached to every man she dates. While being chased is the ideal situation fo r any man, the facts of the matter are that the only way to get a woman to chase you has nothing to do with you. It&#39;s more about her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: -3pt;text-align: left;">First off, it&#39;s impossible to get a strong-minded woman to chase you. A woman who values herself and has a mindset of abundance would never chase a man, no matter how much he tries to manipulate the situation. You can pull back</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;text-align: justify;">and work on your purpose twenty-four hours a day, and she still won&#39;t chase. That&#39;s because people who value them selves and live in a mindset of abundance would never chase someone. This is why I teach high-value principles. W omen will try to manipulate you with all the little games they play, but when you respect yourself as a man, you won &#39;t chase.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This is why I don&#39;t teach manipulation but rather the mindset that you need to succeed in dating. The mindset you ne ed is a mindset of abundance. Even if the woman had a crazy-high interest, she wouldn&#39;t chase you because her pride overrides her interest level. A lot of men don&#39;t have this pride, however, and start chasing once a woman pulls back. I can tell you firsthand I&#39;ve had women I had a very high attraction, and interest in that tried to manipulate me, but I&#39; m too mentally strong for manipulation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manipulation only works on weak individuals. The other aspect is that no matter what you do, there are some wome n whose attraction level you will never be able to get high enough for them to chase you, even if they are mentally w eak. Sometimes you aren&#39;t going to be able to raise every woman&#39;s interest level to the extreme, even if you&#39;re doing and saying all the right things. In this situation, it&#39;s more about compatibility than being a high-value man.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You could do everything right and never get a woman&#39;s interest to extreme levels. Then she meets another guy after you who doesn&#39;t have half of what you have, and she&#39;s all over him. That&#39;s because he&#39;s more compatible with her in what drives her emotions crazy. This is where living a social life of abundance comes in handy. You meet enough w omen to where you meet a woman you do it for without having to try that hard.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can try to be as charming as you want to be, but the woman might not find you that charming. Remember, ever ything in dating is subjective. Have you ever wondered why some women are pursuing you right from the jump, whi le others aren&#39;t? That&#39;s called &quot;catching lightning in a bottle,&quot; and you do it for her. Sometimes you get lucky and me et a woman who you do it for without really trying that much.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 52</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Things a Man Should Never Do with a Woman</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women are irrational, while men are supposed to be rational. Women are emotional, while men are supposed to be r eserved. Women gossip, while men supposedly don&#39;t. I used the phrase&quot;supposed to&quot; because, unfortunately, a lot of men have more estrogen than women do. As a man, you shouldn&#39;t be a Chatty Patty or a man who gossips. You can&#39; t expect women to do specific things with you in the bedroom if you&#39;re the type of guy who tells everyone everybod y&#39;s business - including your own. It&#39;s also a sign of feminine energy, which enhances the chances of your woman m oving into her masculine energy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As a man, it&#39;s always good practice to say as little as possible. You want to be a mystery and have your woman won dering what you&#39;re thinking. Trust is hard to develop but not hard to lose; one slip of the tongue to the wrong person could prevent your woman from trusting you again. I had a woman once who would tell all our business to her famil y members. It got to a point where I didn&#39;t tell her anything that I had going on personally.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The trust was broken, and when trust is gone, the relationship, monogamous or not, is soon to follow. Never try to se ll yourself to a woman, and by &quot;sell yourself,&quot; I&#39;m referring to selling her on your sexual market value. Technically, a date is the thing you have going on. Let women discover your successes on their own.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One way men try to sell themselves to a woman is by trying to inform the woman of their financial status. This is tak ing the beta-male provider route. Men must understand that women don&#39;t respect &quot;tricks.&quot; Tricks are men who spend all their money to get female companionship, either covertly or overtly. The reason women don&#39;t respect this kind o f man is that he doesn&#39;t respect himself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s the same reason a woman can&#39;t respect a man who doesn&#39;t have the strength to walk away when she&#39;s disrespe cting him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can&#39;t expect anyone to respect you, man or woman if you don&#39;t respect yourself. In my opinion, there&#39;s nothing</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">wrong with &quot;peacocking.&quot; Peacocking is when a man dresses nice or has a nice ride. A lot of men might try to procla im themselves peacocking as things they bought for themselves. Still, subconsciously, men buy nice things to attract the highest-quality female they can just like women subconsciously wear sexy clothing to attract the highest-quality mate they can.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even if you&#39;re in a happy monogamous relationship or marriage, your instincts to attract the highest-quality mate ne ver ceases. You should let your success speak for itself; you don&#39;t have to broadcast it. Women are very observant of those types of things. Another way men try to sell themselves is by namedropping or bragging about past relationshi ps with other beautiful women. Men do this to try to show they&#39;re used to her caliber of women.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is a turnoff, as women don&#39;t like to sleep with men who brag about the notches they have in their belts, as wom en intuitively know these men will do the same if they sleep with these men. A woman can tell if you&#39;re successful with other women just by you passing her test. There&#39;s no need to tell a woman about past women you&#39;ve dated. It ac tually can have an adverse effect, as women perceive men who try to brag as insecure men hiding behind their succe ss.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 53</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alpha Male Strategies&#39; Male Hierarchy</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I break down men into six categories. Before I tell you the six classifications for my male archetypes, I want to make something abundantly clear. Each category a man could be in is mainly based on his mindset and how he sees hims elf. The difference between a man who gets women to give him money and a man who feels no woman on earth wa nts him is the difference in how they view themselves and not how women view them. The two primary categories a re alpha and beta males. The six categories are subcategories of these two since all these archetypes fall under one of the two main categories. My first archetype category is pimp. This is the guy who&#39;s able to manipulate women into giving him money. This is not about him being lazy but rather about the entitlement he feels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The idea of the sexual marketplace is a man is supposed to provide protection and stability for a woman for her to co nsider him to be a candidate sexually. A lot of individuals would probably say this has more to do with social progra mming, but I beg to differ. Women are the weaker sex, so it stands to reason that back in the prehistoric days, wome n looked to men to provide these two essential things for survival. The pimp, however, puts more value on himself a s a man and thinks he should be compensated for his attention.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A pimp has the mindset that a woman&#39;s sexual availability isn&#39;t worth his attention by itself. I know the word &quot;pimp&quot; is synonymous with getting women to sell their bodies to provide the man with money, but in the business world, it doesn&#39;t matter how the woman gets the money. Usually, women have regular nine-to-5 jobs to provide financially fo r the man. Do not confuse the pimp with a kept man. In this situation, he&#39;s traded gender roles with the woman in a r elationship. The kept man usually does the house chores, runs errands, and clean to earn his keep. With the pimp, jus t his presence is enough. A lot of men look down on a man like this and view him as a lazy bum, but this is basically because men have been programmed to provide for women, so while I do believe there was a time when men were needed to provide, this doesn&#39;t hold today. Women are no longer dependent on a man for resources and protection, a s a lot of women make their own money. Women making their own money is probably the biggest reason you see so many sexually frustrated men today.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When women were dependent on men, even the lamest men were guaranteed to have sex so long as he had somethin g to offer monetarily. Women making their own money these days has allowed a lot of women to sleep with men de pending on their sexual desires rather than out of necessity and survival. Before the sexual revolution started, any m an would have had just as good a chance as any smooth-talking heartthrob. The sexual revolution and feminism hav e severely hurt men who perceive themselves as beta males because women were no longer required to wait until ma rriage to have sex. This allowed women to sleep with men who perceived themselves as alpha males with impunity. Additionally, these men were hurt because feminism made it OK for women to have jobs and provide for themselve</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">s. This freedom devalued the importance of being a beta-male provider. Being a dating coach for a couple of years n ow, I&#39;ve noticed that everybody thinks they&#39;re an alpha male. To be honest, the only true alpha males are famous, ric h male celebrities with an abundance mindset. The reason I added an &quot;abundance mindset&quot; to the description of a tru</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e alpha male is that there are male celebrities who still live in scarcity despite having women throw themselves at th em.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The term &quot;alpha male&quot; has been distorted and watered down over the years. True alpha males have women chasing t hem. True alpha males are the type of men who women have threesomes with regularly and sleep with solely based on their status. The term &quot;alpha male&quot; originally was used to categorize men who led the pack and slept with all the women. Women pursued them in the hope of having their offspring to replicate they&#39;re genetics. By this definition, e ven I&#39;m not a true alpha male. I have women who send me choosing signals, but true alpha males have women throw ing themselves at them. All famous, rich celebrities aren&#39;t alpha males, as some men still have the beta-male mindset despite obtaining riches and fame. The beta mindset is when, despite having fame and riches, they still think women have more value than they do, causing them to act like betas. The only problem a true alpha male has with women i s which woman he wants to sleep with that day. True alpha males are alpha males due more to their status than to th eir resources. Status will always be the number one characteristic a man could have with women, as it&#39;s the highest f orm of social proof. &quot;Alpha male&quot; also refers to the context and frame you&#39;re dealing with. For instance, the captain of the football team might be the alpha male on campus, but outside that campus, he&#39;s a regular Joe because he no lo nger has that status at his disposal.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A manager at a job might be the alpha male to employees, specifically the female employees, but once he clocks out, he&#39;s a regular Joe. I think we&#39;ve all seen how women clamor to sleep with or date the boss so as long as he had an al pha mindset. I call these types of alpha males &quot;situational alpha males.&quot; I label them this because true alpha males ha ve women pursuing them in any situation. A lot of men who were the man in college found it a lot harder to attract women once they graduated. Now that I&#39;ve gotten what true alpha male is out the way, I will tell you what an alpha male is for the other 99 percent of men on earth, including myself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I classify these men as &quot;all-around alpha males.&quot; These men are self-employed and can sleep with women without pr oviding anything financially. Maybe you meet them for a drink, but by and large, you don&#39;t do anything extraordinar y to sleep with women. For the guys who might claim themselves to be alpha males while working for someone else</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">, I would counter that by suggesting that no true alpha male would work for someone else long term. If you&#39;re worki ng for someone else to start your own business, then that&#39;s fine, but if you&#39;re content with being an employee, there&#39;s no way you can classify yourself as an all-around alpha male. One of the biggest characteristics of being an all-arou nd alpha male is risk-taking. If you&#39;re content with being an employee, then that in itself shows you&#39;re not a risk-take</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">r. Men who perceive themselves as alpha males just have a hard time taking orders from someone else. The next cat egory is probably better suited for men who either struggle financially or work for someone else but have no trouble sleeping with women without providing anything financially. I refer to them as the &quot;sexual alpha males.&quot; These are t he men that can sweet talk the pants off of most of the women they meet. This sweet-talking ability comes from a co nfidence in themselves that most men couldn&#39;t imagine. The difference between the sexual alpha and the pimp is the pimp gets money from women, while the sexual alpha just gets sex. It takes a little more game to get a woman to giv e you money than to just get sex. It also takes a different mindset, as the pimp believes his time is worth more than j ust sex.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It takes a lot of confidence in one&#39;s ability to achieve that perfect pitch in one&#39;s voice to turn women on. It&#39;s not an ou tright skill, but rather a trait any man could have once he truly develops confidence in himself. Understand that if yo u take women out on fancy dates to impress them to sleep with them, then you are providing something. I do take w omen on nice dates, but it&#39;s after we&#39;ve slept together, and it&#39;s something I want to do, and she&#39;s just my company. It just boils down to mindset and motive. Either you go on nice dates because it&#39;s something you truly want to do, whic h means it&#39;s about you, or you can do it because you&#39;re trying to impress the woman. The downside to this category other than the obvious (of these men not having their lives in order) is that a woman&#39;s attraction is 100percent depen dent on their swagger since they have nothing to provide.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That means that if they ever catch feelings or lose their confidence, they won&#39;t have anything else to maintain the wo man&#39;s attraction. This mindset also limits the number of women who see them as viable. A lot of women won&#39;t give you the time of day if you don&#39;t have your life in order, no matter how charismatic they may find you. A &quot;sexual bet a&quot; is the type of man who kicks butt in the business world but suffers in the romance department. A sexual beta mig ht be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company but hasn&#39;t had any women interested in him romantically for months at a ti</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">me.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even when he does get women to be interested in him, it&#39;s based solely on his resources and has very little to do with him. This lack of sexual interest causes him to rely more and more on his resources, which then causes him to never develop the swagger needed to be successful with women. From my experience, most sexual betas seem to be conte nt with this arraignment, as their social programming for being a provider overrules any rational thought otherwise. This just goes to show you that despite having status and financial success, nothing overrides a man&#39;s perception of h imself and his mindset. I&#39;ve seen men with fame and riches act like they were just happy to have some woman with a cute face who makes minimum wage give them the time of day. It&#39;s quite amazing to see how a man in one aspect o f his life could be so risk-taking and optimistic but so cowardly and pessimistic in another. My theory for this is som e men just don&#39;t want to accept that beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Most men have this perception of what is c onsidered good looking, and since they don&#39;t meet those criteria, they automatically assume they&#39;re destined to be a b eta-male provider.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While I do agree that some standards of beauty are &quot;widely&#39;&#39; accepted, the key thing to note is that you&#39;re always bea utiful to someone somewhere, no matter how you look. The upside to being a beta-male provider is that depending o n what you make financially, you could sleep with the same caliber of women as the men who perceive themselves a lpha males do. Admittedly, it would be for different reasons, and it wouldn&#39;t feel the same, but the facts remain the s ame. There are a lot of men who perceive themselves as beta males who sleep with very beautiful women simply be cause they are successful. Some men have no confidence in themselves entirely.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I classify these men as &quot;all-around beta males.&quot; An all-around beta male is an individual who either struggles financi ally or just accepts his fate as being an employee for the rest of his life while he also struggles in the romance depart ment. The reason these guys struggle with women is directly linked to their financial situation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When a man perceives himself as a beta male and is not successful, it&#39;s only natural for him to struggle with women, since his confidence level is directly linked to what he can provide financially. As I&#39;ve mentioned before, I firmly be lieve that any man can go from any category he wants; it&#39;s just a matter of mindset. However, these are the men who let insecurity they have to make them feel like betas. It&#39;s like how some people who are born poor think they have to stay poor. You can go from poor to rich if you&#39;re willing to put the work in, and you can go from a beta mindset to a n alpha mindset if you change your outlook on life. I think I&#39;m alpha; therefore, I am alpha. I don&#39;t care how anyone else views me. You think you&#39;re beta; therefore, you&#39;re beta. It&#39;s all a matter of perception. Every woman I date does n&#39;t view me as an alpha male; therefore, I don&#39;t date them very long, as I want to spend the majority of my time datin g women who view me as an alpha male. These men usually end up with women they aren&#39;t that attracted to but figu re something is better than nothing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Have you ever wondered why your best friend is married to a woman twice his body weight? I can guarantee you th at he didn&#39;t have many women who looked like Halle Berry in his phone book. I know a lot of men who perceive the mselves as beta males who have some charisma, but their scarcity mindset overrides it. My last archetype is the &quot;inc el,&quot; which stands for &quot;involuntary celibate.&quot; Incels can be well off financially, but due to their lack of social skills an d awareness, they&#39;re unable to attract a woman or many friends for that matter. This means the man wants to engage in sexual activity but is unable to find women to sleep with him. My suggestion to this type of individual would be t o improve themselves, but a lot of incels aren&#39;t even what the average person would consider bad-looking or destitut e guys. From my observation, most incels lack the social skills needed to attract women. Based on the videos I&#39;ve se en online from incels, the men have a lack of social skills and awareness. As a man, if you lack social skills and awa reness, you&#39;re going to come across as creepy to women. By &quot;creepy,&quot; I&#39;m referring to awkwardness when you&#39;re in t he vicinity of women.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is usually due to a lack of socializing, causing you to overly stare or come across as weird when you&#39;re in the pr oximity of women. A lot of the time, whether you&#39;re coming across as creepy is based on the woman&#39;s attraction leve l toward you, but that&#39;s not always the case. When a man lacks an adequate social life, he lacks the social skills need ed to not stare too hard, which sends off the signals of a creep. This is creepy to women because you stare but don&#39;t make a move. This creeps women out because you seem interested, but you never say anything. This is the same situ ation you see when people lack proper social lives, and when they come in contact with others, they act overly excit</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ed, causing them to talk too much. This over talking can prevent you from making friends, causing the cycle to const antly repeat itself since you don&#39;t have many if any, friends. What&#39;s my suggestion? Put the video games down, get o ut of the house, and live a social life. The problem isn&#39;t going to fix itself; you have to fix it. You have to socialize to develop social skills and awareness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 54</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Only Red- and Purple-Pill Men Can Be Alpha Males</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A major component to having so many women perceive you as a beta male is your ignorance toward the female natu re. Red-pill men generally have a good understanding of female nature and thus don&#39;t make silly mistakes, like over pursuing. Red-pill men know women are dating multiple men when they meet them; therefore, they aren&#39;t surprised when a woman just up and disappears out of their life. Being a red pill isn&#39;t the only factor in becoming a man who p erceives himself as an alpha male, but it is, however, a major component. Most men who perceive themselves as alp ha males got their red-pill knowledgable from sleeping with women in relationships rather than from heartbreak. I&#39;m aware that some of you may have become red pill after going through heartbreak, but a lot of men like myself got it from either watching how females in our families treated the men they would date or sleeping with women in relatio nships.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The reason being red pill is such a major component to becoming a man who perceives himself as an alpha male is t hat once you understand female nature, you&#39;re incapable of falling into a scarcity mindset because you now know ho w female minds operate. This newfound knowledge prevents you from ever giving yourself 100% to a female, theref ore preventing you from falling into a scarcity mindset. Don&#39;t think being red pill means you&#39;re an alpha male. You c an be a red-pill beta male. What I am saying, however, is that you can&#39;t be an alpha male without being a red pill. M en who perceive themselves as betas can still be red pill and beta because they still may have insecurities about them selves that prevent them from developing an abundance mindset despite their knowledge about female nature. Insec urities a man has in himself are and always will be the greatest determinant of how a man views himself. Combine t his with a lack of a social life, and you have the recipe for a man living with a scarcity mindset.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For instance, I don&#39;t let my receding hairline or speech impediment cause me to lose confidence in myself or make me feel less attractive to women. Men who perceive themselves as beta males but are red-pill aware let insecurities l ike height and a larger nose kill their self-esteem. This, in turn, puts them in a scarcity mindset. A red-pill alpha mal e never falls into scarcity because even when he meets a woman that seems perfect, he understands that the woman i s not his but rather that it&#39;s just his turn. A scarcity mindset is the biggest factor in why some men perceive themselv es as beta males. Red-pill men don&#39;t believe in &quot;the one&quot; myth because they understand women can&#39;t fight against th eir hypergamous nature.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 55</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Confidence Is Not Universal</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dating coaches always emphasize the importance of confidence as if confidence is some magical substance you can buy at the store. What is confidence, and where does it come from? Why are some men confident, while others aren&#39; t? Well, I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s such a thing as a universally confident man. I believe confidence is a situational thing, and it wanes from time to time. Success, familiarity, and a mindset of abundance cause us to have confidence in diff erent situations. There&#39;s no doubt that if you have a lot of success with women, you&#39;re going to be confident with wo men, but what if the last twenty women you approached rejected you?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How are you to remain confident? This is where the mindset of abundance comes into play. You can take a player li ke Kobe Bryant, who was a volume shooter; he would never let a couple of bad shots, or bad games for that matter, l ower his confidence - or did it? I would assert that a couple of bad games would lower any man&#39;s confidence tempor arily. The difference is that Kobe knows what a lot of men who have success with women, or success with anything for that matter, know: it&#39;s just a matter of time before he&#39;s making shots again. The law of averages says that you&#39;re b ound to have a bad game here and there, or in the example of approaching and dating women, you&#39;re bound to run in to a cold streak eventually, no matter who you are. Everybody&#39;s confidence goes up and down from time to time just depending on how much success they&#39;re having at any given point in time in a particular activity, but some seem to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">understand the law of averages, while others don&#39;t. I really can&#39;t give you a good explanation as to why some people aren&#39;t able to develop this mindset of abundance, while others, with just a little self-improvement, are. The only thin g I can come up with is that some men have been so socially programmed to what truly attracts women that they just give up.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I won&#39;t kid you and act like there isn&#39;t a general guideline to what&#39;s a good-looking man because that would be dising enuous, but the facts remain the same: you don&#39;t need two billion women to find you attractive. All you need is a fe w women to find you attractive. I won&#39;t say one woman because the odds of you finding that one woman would be v irtually impossible. The reason I say that confidence is not universal is that the same guy who lacks confidence with women might be confident in almost every other aspect of his life. I&#39;ve had male friends who were very confident in approaching women but who lacked that same confidence in virtually every other aspect of life. That assertion leads me to believe that confidence isn&#39;t really about confidence at all but rather not having a fear of failure or rejection.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A lot of men have this fear of being rejected when approaching women. That&#39;s because they take the rejection as a ju dgment as to who they are as an individual, when in fact timing is and always will be the biggest factor when determ ining whether you get rejected by women. Had you met that same woman a month earlier or a month later, she migh t&#39;ve been open to dating you, but maybe right now, she&#39;s not in the right frame of mind to date, or maybe she just had a long day at work, and you approached her on the wrong day despite you being her type physically. For the men w ho are confused as to why confidence is so attractive to women, the answer is pretty simple. When a man has confid ence, women instinctively know that confidence must come from somewhere. Women know a man who has confide nce must be successful with women, hence the confidence he exudes. A man&#39;s confidence level is directly linked to his sexual market value.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A confident man must have options. As I&#39;ve said before, a man&#39;s sexual market value is based on the highest-quality female he can attract. Muscles and money have nothing to do with a man&#39;s sexual market value directly. They can in directly affect his sexual market value by increasing his confidence, which in turn attracts a highly attractive female, but that&#39;s about it. If money and muscles were responsible for a man&#39;s sexual market value, then why are there men with money and muscles who struggle with women? The reason men with money and muscles struggle with women is that despite the appearance of being a confident man, insecurities still linger inside. Money can&#39;t hide your insecur ities. Money makes your insecurities more prominent because you&#39;ll tend to lead with your wallet instead of with yo ur personality. The only thing that can cause a man to lose his insecurities is to learn how to accept his flaws as a hu man being. We all have flaws; even that drop-dead gorgeous woman at your gym has flaws. If you don&#39;t think wome n have insecurities, then think again.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pretty much every woman on reality TV has had some kind of cosmetic surgery done. When a man lacks confidence</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">, he&#39;s subconsciously sending a message to the woman that he&#39;s not very successful with women, hence the lack of c onfidence. You should never hesitate when you want to approach a woman. Hesitation is a sign of a man who doubt s himself. The woman intuitively knows you must get rejected quite often or are not very successful with women to doubt yourself, which is a turnoff. Trust me when I say a woman knows when you want to approach her. That twent y minutes it took you to build up your courage to approach could cost you a great opportunity with a woman. When a woman meets you initially, more often than not she&#39;s unaware of your sexual market value. The only thing women can use to gauge it is your confidence level. They gauge your confidence level by your tone, body language, eye con tact, and conversational skill.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 56</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women Also Play the Game</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Contrary to popular belief, you can have too much of an abundance mindset. As with everything in life, too much of anything is not good. One thing that is all too common is for men to go from one extreme to the other. Men go from blowing up a woman&#39;s phone to waiting two weeks to ask her out again. Either scenario is ideal, but when done with the correct balance, you will get your desired outcome. I teach men to have an abundance mindset, which keeps you from pursuing women with below-average or lukewarm interest. Lukewarm interest is when a woman sees you as a five or six on a scale of ten.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Women are well aware of the difference between how a man treats them when he&#39;s unsure of their interest level and when he makes it blatantly obvious. Men tend to take a woman who shows her interest for granted, thus preventing her from being courted properly as she desires. I can attest to the fact that I&#39;ve treated women when I was unsure of t heir interest level better than I treated the women who made their interest obvious.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If a woman isn&#39;t pursuing you, that shouldn&#39;t be grounds to stop pursuing her, unless you have a woman who you&#39;re more interested in or you are just no longer interested in her. The woman could have legitimate interest but is simply concealing her interest in the hope of creating value. You&#39;ll know when women don&#39;t have or have lost interest beca use they&#39;ll stop making themselves available. I want men to develop an abundance mindset, but if you&#39;re moving on from women who aren&#39;t doing backflips on dates, then you could very well be missing out on some favorable dating situations. You should also have the confidence that you can raise any woman&#39;s interest so long as it&#39;s not too low to begin with. The reason for this is that the lower her initial attraction, the more you have to invest initially.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This means it will take more dates and more of your non-sexual attention to raising her interest in where she&#39;s comfo rtable sleeping with you. The abundance mindset comes into play when you&#39;re dealing with women who flake on dat es, won&#39;t set dates, try to reschedule dates constantly, or try to use you as a backup plan. You&#39;ll recognize this by the famous low-interest phrases women use: &quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll let you know.&quot; My motto is as long as she&#39;s making dat es, and the dates are progressing, then keep pursuing. Just make sure she&#39;s initiating a contact from time to time too.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I&#39;ve already stated, when a woman wants you, she&#39;ll initiate contact no matter how structured she is. That date&#39;s prog ress should be emphasized because you have women out there who will let you take them out repeatedly even thoug h they have no romantic interest in you. I can&#39;t tell you how many possible great experiences I&#39;ve blown due to havin g such high standards from women on the initial meetings when the women were probably playing the game.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 57</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Losing Sexual Market Value over Time</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A common fear of men is the phrase &#39;&#39;You&#39;re going to die old and lonely.&quot; The good news for men is that women do n&#39;t put nearly as much emphasis on looks as we do. Before you get overly excited, you must understand that just bec ause women don&#39;t put as much emphasis on looks as we do, looks do matter to women, especially initially because y ou have to meet their minimum attraction level. Thinking anything different would be delusional. A man&#39;s sex appea l is the most important attribute, outside of status, to women. As only a select few men have the status of a celebrity, sex appeal is going to be the biggest attraction to women for99 percent of men. Sex appeal is a combination of a lot of factors, such as confidence, charisma, swagger, and looks. I don&#39;t consider swagger and confidence the same beca use I classify swagger as the way a man carries himself particularly the way he walks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Confidence is just your state of being. Some men just have more of a swagger when they carry themselves. A man&#39;s appearance can&#39;t improve with age unless he wasn&#39;t optimizing his appearance when he was younger, such as by carr ying excess weight, having poor fashion sense, and so on. As with anything, there, of course, will always be outliers who were able to maintain, if not improve, their appearance with aging. The best way to keep your sexual market val ue as high as possible while aging is to maintain a healthy weight. Unwanted fat adds a lot of years to your appearan ce besides the fact that it&#39;s just not attractive to a majority of women. Fat used to be associated with wealth centuries ago, but today it&#39;s mostly associated with laziness and low self-esteem. The average woman is attracted to the opposi te of her. Women&#39;s bodies are soft, and men&#39;s bodies are supposed to be hard. As with any measure of attractiveness, while the overwhelming majority of the public might find one particular trait attractive, there will always be outliers</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are women out there who like fat men. Some of these women might prefer fat men because they feel fat men h ave far fewer options than fit men, thus emphasizing the insecurities they may have, but let&#39;s also keep in mind that t here are different strokes for different folks. Some women are genuinely attracted to fat men. Feminine women are a ttracted to masculine men, and soft women largely aren&#39;t attracted to men softer than they are. You should strive to e at a well-balanced diet of green vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats and drink plenty of water. Green vegetabl es provide antioxidants that slow down the aging process. Water keeps your skin hydrated, which slows the aging pr ocess. The more acidic things you put into your body, the faster you&#39;re going to age your skin. Keep in mind that all</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">this just slows down the aging process and doesn&#39;t stop it completely. We&#39;re all going to get old and gray one day, bu t I don&#39;t see anything wrong with slowing the process as much as possible.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Last, as you get older, you have to make sure your finances are on point. As an older man, you can&#39;t expect to have t he same sexual market value as you did when you were younger unless your finances have increased. A good way o f looking at it is, as you&#39;re looks deteriorate, your finances increase. Women do not have this luxury, thus they start t o put more emphasis on settling down as they age. Men care very little about how much money a woman makes, wh ich is why you&#39;ll see plenty of women who aren&#39;t married at an older age pushing so hard for a relationship. That&#39;s be cause they know their best days are behind them, and they are looking to nab the highest- quality male they can with what&#39;s left of their youth and beauty. If you&#39;re a red-pill man and content with casually dating and non-monogamous relationships, I think you have to put a lot of emphasis on creating the type of lifestyle that more than makes up for what you lack physically. As an older man, you have to be completely delusional if you want to attract women half y our age when you&#39;re fifty years old and expect your financial stability not to play a major role in that attraction.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Of course, as with anything, there will be outliers who can do this, but they&#39;re called outliers for a reason and should n&#39;t be expected to be the norm. Most men have an issue with being considered beta-male providers, but this should n ot be an issue when you get older. A fifty-year-old man shouldn&#39;t expect a twenty-two-year-old to be highly attracte d to him physically. Of course, you still could charm her panties off, but it&#39;s just not practical to think a woman half your age once you reach fifty is only with you for just you. I know for a fact that women do not show men they perc eive as beta providers the same affection and respect as they do to men they perceive as alpha males, but my rebuttal to these men with this issue would be to keep the engagements brief. If you choose to date women who perceive yo u as a beta male, then at the very minimum, keep it to once a week. Don&#39;t try to build anything with women who vie w you as a beta male because you&#39;ll always have this feeling of emptiness when dealing with them, which in turn ca uses you to doubt yourself and lose confidence, which then actually makes you classify yourself as a beta male. Onc e you deem yourself a beta male, it&#39;s hard to ever consider yourself an alpha male, as you start to accept your value t o women to only be financial.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 58</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Signs of a Manipulative Woman</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s always nice to date women with high-interest from the start. They make it very easy to date them and alleviate an y nervousness when you reach out to set the next date. There are some women, however, who, beyond just exhibitin g initial high interest, will go as far as to express their interest verbally or through text message. This is always a red flag to men because women are taught to play hard to get. Women are taught this because it makes men value them more. So why would some women overly express their interest level if they&#39;re taught to play hard to get? The answe r is simple: manipulation. Now, some women will have a genuinely high interest, but some will purposely lure you i n with extremely high cooperation. Men chase cooperation, while women chase validation. By &quot;cooperation,&quot; I&#39;m ref erring to how easy a woman makes it for you at the initial meeting.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unfortunately, you won&#39;t be able to tell which woman is which until you start to date them. I&#39;ll admit that sometimes a man can do things to lower a woman&#39;s interest, but if you&#39;ve been following me for a while, I think it&#39;s safe to say you aren&#39;t doing anything to lower her interest. These are the women who will make it so easy for you initially only t o pull back later. I&#39;m not telling you to shy away from women exhibiting high interest; what I am telling you is to be on the lookout for women who purposely display high interest initially only to pull back later. These women purpos ely express crazy- high initial interest only to later pull back to get you to chase them. The thing is, you&#39;re not chasin g a woman because had she displayed that level of interest, it&#39;s very unlikely you would have pursued her, but since she made things so easy initially, you&#39;re chasing the level of initial cooperation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Highly manipulative women have several reasons for this, but commonly it&#39;s done for merely their enjoyment. Some women just get off on manipulating men because it&#39;s fun to them. I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t date women who dis play high interest initially, but you should be cognizant of what might happen. Just think to yourself for a second: ho w many women have you dated that showed a tremendous amount of initial interest, and it stayed that way for an ext ended period? I&#39;m well aware of it being her feeling of newness at meeting a new guy, or perhaps you no longer con sider yourself an alpha, causing her interest to drop, but more often than not, it has nothing to do with you. Rather, it&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">s just some sick thrill some women get out of playing with men&#39;s emotions. There&#39;s an old saying: &quot;If something is t oo good to be true, it usually is.&quot; I think that statement is true when it comes to dating women who exhibit crazy-hig h initial interest. As a high-value man, you shouldn&#39;t be so easily manipulated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 59</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women Popping Up Unannounced and Nesting</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women who&#39;ve made it their agenda to get you in a relationship have a couple of tricks up their sleeves to do this. W omen have a way of marking their territory, so to speak. One way that women accomplish this is by popping up una nnounced at your residence. They do this in the hope of having you in a state of paranoia about bringing other wome n to your residence, despite you making your intentions known about having an open relationship. As a high- value man, you have to have boundaries, and this crosses a boundary. Even if you&#39;re in a monogamous relationship, no on e should pop up announced unless the two of you are living together.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re in a monogamous relationship, and trust is an issue, then you should let her know that a lack of trust isn&#39;t go ing to work. If you&#39;ve cheated and have gotten caught, then you have to let her know either she&#39;s going to have to tru st you again or you&#39;re better off being single. When a woman doesn&#39;t trust you, she can turn your life into a living he ll of insecurities. While I understand where the insecurities come from, and rightfully so, I&#39;m not about to walk on eg gshells dealing with someone else&#39;s insecurities. Women also pop up unannounced to see how much they can get aw ay with a shit test of sorts. If you let this go unchecked, it&#39;ll only get worse from there. I wouldn&#39;t say this is a fireabl e offense, but it&#39;s worthy of letting them know what type of behavior will not be tolerated. Women are just like anyb ody else in society; they test to see where the boundaries are. You have to let it be known from the start what your b oundaries are.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women also have the uncanny ability to leave behind items of theirs at your residence. This is not done by accident. This is a woman&#39;s way of marking her territory to other women who may come over to your residence. This is called nesting. You can try to remind her to make sure she doesn&#39;t leave items behind at your residence, but she&#39;ll just play coy and act as if it was an innocent mistake. Although you may have informed other women about the fact that you&#39; re only interested in an open relationship, it&#39;s still a mood killer for women to find other women&#39;s items left behind. To avoid this, you should do a house sweep when every woman leaves your residence. Sometimes a woman may thi nk she&#39;s the only woman you&#39;re dating, although the conversation about exclusivity hasn&#39;t come up yet.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To be fair, you don&#39;t owe anybody an explanation if the exclusivity talk hasn&#39;t come up yet. You&#39;re not lying to anyb ody, because as far as you&#39;re concerned, she&#39;s dating multiple men. Dating one person at a time is stupid and not a ve ry effective way to find a significant other if that&#39;s something you aspire to obtain. Until you&#39;re exclusive with a wo man, it&#39;s always best to date multiple women because it offers you the best opportunity to meet a woman who is com patible with you instead of just settling for the next best thing. If the topic comes up, then you should always be ope n about your dating life, as it&#39;s a sign of having a scarcity mindset to lie to women about your dating life. A man sho uld have the mindset that either she&#39;s down with who you are or she&#39;s not; why do you think women are so open abo ut their children on their dating profiles or when you first meet them?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That&#39;s because women are of the mindset that if a man can&#39;t handle them having kids, then he can go kick rocks. Me n should have this same kind of mindset. Never lie about your finances, income, and so on to get laid. It&#39;s not becaus e you&#39;re a man of morals; it&#39;s because you&#39;re a man with an abundance mindset that says, &quot;Accept me for who I am.&quot; You must understand that once you become a high-value man, you control the pace at which the relationship progres ses after the initial meeting. Women control the pace initially because they are the gatekeepers for sex, but high-valu e men control the pace of the relationship.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 60</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women, You Should Not Take-Back</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I teach men to leave women when they become disrespectful and to only take them back if they&#39;re willing to make it up to the men. This could be them cooking for you, cleaning your place, and so on. It doesn&#39;t always have to be som ething sexual. It&#39;s key that a man makes a woman prove herself before taking her back because you don&#39;t want wome</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">n feeling like they can come in and go out of your life whenever they get ready. I know you&#39;re probably thinking, &quot;I broke up with her,&quot; but I beg to differ. Women are passive-aggressive, and when they want out of a relationship, the y&#39;re notorious for pushing men away with bad behavior. Despite this intolerable behavior, some men still don&#39;t have the balls to leave the relationship due to their scarcity mindset. If you are one of the few men who have the balls to l eave the relationship, there are a few situations where I advise you to do so.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you catch a woman cheating, you must leave that relationship. Women are way more thoughtful than men, and the fact that she even got caught is indicative of her respect level for you. Women cheat primarily for one of a few reas ons. Either she&#39;s not getting the emotional support from home, she&#39;s not being satisfied sexually at home, she perceiv es you as a beta male, or she views you as an alpha male and the relationship has lost all of its sexual tension.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;m not saying that if a woman views you as a beta male that she&#39;s automatically going to cheat, but if the opportunit y presents itself, she will, more than likely. When I&#39;m referring to the opportunity presenting itself, I&#39;m referring to meeting a man she perceives as an alpha male and him understanding how to play his role, which is that he understa nds that this is a strictly sexual relationship and nothing more. It&#39;s better if she&#39;s cheating for sexual desire than for e motional reasons because if she&#39;s cheating for emotional reasons, it means she&#39;s bonded with the other guy, and you&#39;r e her beta- male provider at that point; nonetheless, either situation is not ideal. This is one of the many reasons you shouldn&#39;t even consider engaging in anything long term or serious with a woman who views you as a beta-male prov ider. She&#39;s way more likely to cheat to get that sexual desire met.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although it may be better if a woman is cheating for sexual desire rather than for emotional support, I would still ad vise against taking a woman back who&#39;s been caught cheating no matter the reason. The primary reason is that as a h igh-value male, you have goals in life you&#39;re trying to obtain; how are you supposed to conquer the world if you&#39;re w ondering what your girl is doing? You&#39;ll live in a state of constant paranoia. Here&#39;s the catch, though; despite her bei ng the one who caused your insecurities, she&#39;ll start to lose attraction due to your insecurities. Isn&#39;t that something? S ave yourself the headache, and just let her go. It also stands to reason: how much respect do you think she&#39;ll have for a man who takes a woman back who got caught cheating?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is like the Mount Rushmore of scarcity mindsets. You should also never get back with a woman who&#39;s caught y ou cheating. I often refer to men who get caught cheating as the world&#39;s biggest cockblockers, so I think it&#39;s a simp move if you cheat in a monogamous relationship. That aside, if you do, however, cheat and get caught, I think it&#39;s a bad idea to get back with that woman.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women can be vindictive, and you&#39;ll always be looking over your shoulder, waiting for her to get back at you. You must also consider the aspect that she&#39;ll most likely never trust you again. Her not trusting you again presents anothe r problem in itself. If she doesn&#39;t trust you, then it stands to reason that she&#39;ll never give herself to you completely. In other words, she&#39;ll hold back. When a woman holds back, you can expect it to feel like you&#39;re alone even though yo u&#39;re in a relationship. You should never take a woman back who hit you or made any kind of physical contact.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The reason for this is simple: as a high-value man, you&#39;re not going to risk your career and freedom for some overly emotional woman who&#39;s incapable of keeping her hands to herself. Dealing with these kinds of women puts you in a position to defend yourself in a society where men aren&#39;t allowed to defend themselves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Don&#39;t me wrong; I don&#39;t think a man should hit a woman, but it&#39;s not because you shouldn&#39;t be allowed to defend you rself. I believe you shouldn&#39;t hit a woman because you should&#39;ve left that toxic relationship long ago. Toxic relations hips where the woman is hitting the man aren&#39;t an overnight situation. These relationships have been toxic for a very long time. As a high-value man, you should&#39;ve left long ago. If a woman hits you, it&#39;s because she&#39;s lost all respect f or you. When I&#39;m referring to her loss of respect, I&#39;m referring to you not having the strength to leave her despite her unruly behavior for months, if not longer. That loss of respect has culminated in her resorting to violence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even if you didn&#39;t have the strength to leave, you must understand that this woman&#39;s interest is at rock bottom and u nder no circumstances should you ever consider taking her back. The reason for this, other than the Women can be v indictive, and you&#39;ll always be looking over your shoulder, waiting for her to get back at you. You must also conside r the aspect that she&#39;ll most likely never trust you again. Her not trusting you again presents another problem in itself</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">. If she doesn&#39;t trust you, then it stands to reason that she&#39;ll never give herself to you completely. In other words, she&#39; ll hold back. When a woman holds back, you can expect it to feel like you&#39;re alone even though you&#39;re in a relationsh ip. You should never take a woman back who hit you or made any kind of physical contact. The reason for this is si mple: as a high-value man, you&#39;re not going to risk your career and freedom for some overly emotional woman who&#39; s incapable of keeping her hands to herself. Dealing with these kinds of women puts you in a position to defend your self in a society where men aren&#39;t allowed to defend themselves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Don&#39;t me wrong; I don&#39;t think a man should hit a woman, but it&#39;s not because you shouldn&#39;t be allowed to defend you rself. I believe you shouldn&#39;t hit a woman because you should&#39;ve left that toxic relationship long ago. Toxic relations hips where the woman is hitting the man aren&#39;t an overnight situation. These relationships have been toxic for a very long time. As a high-value man, you should&#39;ve left long ago. If a woman hits you, it&#39;s because she&#39;s lost all respect f or you. When I&#39;m referring to her loss of respect, I&#39;m referring to you not having the strength to leave her despite her unruly behavior for months, if not longer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That loss of respect has culminated in her resorting to violence. Even if you didn&#39;t have the strength to leave, you mu st understand that this woman&#39;s interest is at rock bottom and under no circumstances should you ever consider takin g her back. The reason for this, other than the obvious, is that once a woman gets physical with you, it&#39;s highly likely she will again in the future. Some women take advantage of how men are incapable of defending themselves and us e it to their benefit. You don&#39;t want to have a woman who&#39;s purposely trying to provoke you into an altercation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The final situation where a man shouldn&#39;t take a woman back is when he catches her invading his privacy. This can be going through his phone, rambling through his closet, and so on. The reason for this is simple: you must trust you r woman. You shouldn&#39;t fear leaving your woman in your home while you run an errand. I know that it&#39;s female natu re to snoop around, but men should never tolerate this type of behavior. If it was something you wanted her to know, then you would have told her about it. That&#39;s an invasion of privacy, and if you catch it, you should end that relation ship immediately.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 61</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Staying in a Relationship for the Kids</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A lot of men with kids claim that despite having a woman who&#39;s out of control, they&#39;re going to stay in the relationsh ip for the kids. I understand some men want to be around their children growing up, as family court is very unfair to men as far as custody goes. So what I get is a lot of questions about how to get a woman to respect them without lea ving her. That&#39;s like asking me how to get rich without working. You can have your cake and eat it too.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Relationships are about leverage, and being married with kids gives the woman leverage in the relationship. A man has the leverage when the woman knows he&#39;ll leave if she&#39;s uncooperative. I know a lot of people will read that last s tatement and think, &quot;Relationships are not about leverage, but rather love and commitment.&quot; Pretty much every aspe ct of your life is about leverage if you think about it. How much you get paid at your job is based on how in-demand you are.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If you have several companies vying for your services, then you&#39;re way more likely to get a better salary than if you don&#39;t. If you have several friends you can call on, then all of your friends would undoubtedly treat you better since y ou have no scarcity of friends. If you run a business, and you have hundreds of customers, you&#39;re not going to tolerat e unruly patrons as you would if you only had a few customers. I saw this firsthand at a gym I worked at in Manhatt an. A potential new member of the gym tried to negotiate a better deal for their membership, and the member adviso r told them right there on the spot that they didn&#39;t negotiate prices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In other words, &quot;Here&#39;s our price. Either you want it, or you don&#39;t.&quot; Abundance creates respect from your peers and, more importantly, your woman. Children or not, the only way a man can maintain leverage and respect in a relations hip is that the woman has to know he has no problem leaving the relationship. If a woman has the leverage, she loses attraction for the man because, at that point, she has the power in the relationship. Despite feminism being so preval ent in today&#39;s society, women still subconsciously want a man that can lead. I hate to say this, but it has to be said.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let&#39;s be honest, most of you not leaving doesn&#39;t have that much to do with the kids. It&#39;s mostly about you and your sc arcity mindset. In reality, you&#39;re using the children as a scapegoat as to why you&#39;re unable to leave. The fact of the m atter is, every man needs to show his woman he&#39;s willing to leave if she isn&#39;t cooperating. I don&#39;t have children, but I&#39; m well aware and familiar with acquiring assets with a woman. These assets could be a home or car you may have p urchased together. It is as if you are giving up the large chunk of your life that it took to acquire those assets, but I w ould counter that assertion: what&#39;s your self-respect and peace of mind worth? So while I understand your dilemma, the facts remain the same.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For the few men who are staying in these toxic relationships, you would be doing your children more harm than goo</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">d. While ideally, a two-parent home is better, you must understand that only applies if it&#39;s a loving relationship. Well</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">, it doesn&#39;t have to be exactly loving but at least not toxic. How much good do you think you&#39;re doing your kids if M om and Dad are bickering all the time? They&#39;ll grow up thinking that this is normal. If you have sons, they&#39;ll grow u p beta, thinking it&#39;s normal for the woman to wear the pants, and if you have a daughter, she&#39;ll grow up masculine, th inking women are supposed to run the household. Coincidentally, this is why you have so many men letting women run the relationship while these men stay feeling emasculated. Women don&#39;t respect words; they only respect action. You not leaving shows her you have no sexual market value, thus why you&#39;re afraid to leave.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This kills her attraction to you since she figures you can&#39;t get anyone else, and that&#39;s why you take her crap. Acting more masculine won&#39;t put her back in her feminine energy. The only thing that will get her back into her feminine en ergy is for you to raise her attraction level back up. And the only thing that can raise her attraction level back up is to show her you have options. A man&#39;s options are directly linked to preselection. If you decide to stay in the relations hip, you must understand that the best you&#39;ll be able to do is get her to respect you. I highly doubt you&#39;ll be able to g et the passion back into the relationship. I&#39;m a firm believer that once that&#39;s gone, it never comes back.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Maybe the passion never comes back, but if you have her respect, at least she won&#39;t be a headache. Pre-selection is a lways king with attraction. It&#39;s another form of status. As a man, you always have to work to improve your sexual m arket value so your woman knows you have other options. A woman only respects a man if he has options. You mig ht&#39;ve noticed a common theme. Men have to leave toxic, disrespectful relationships. If you&#39;re wondering why I menti on it so much, it is because I&#39;m assuming that if you&#39;re reading this book, your woman is probably being a pain in the butt. Men are trying to figure out how to get their women to respect them without doing what needs to be done. It ki nd of reminds me of how overweight people try to find ways to lose weight other than diet and exercise. It&#39;s hard for a reason, but little gimmicks don&#39;t work. Respect is earned, not given. Assertiveness is something women find very a ttractive.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Being assertive is achieved when you&#39;re able to express your point or convey your message without getting overly a ggressive and emotional. The only way you can be assertive is if a woman knows there are consequences behind you r words. Speak softly and carry a big stick.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 62</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You Must-Have Game</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The word &quot;game&quot; is derived from the phrase &quot;game plan.&quot; To attract a woman, you need a game plan. To sleep with a woman, you need a game plan. To get a woman to want a relationship - for men who desire a wife- you need to ha ve a game plan to entice the woman to marry you. The game plan you use to entice a woman is going to vary from w oman to woman. Football teams don&#39;t use the same game plan for every football game, and you won&#39;t be able to use the same game plan for every woman. A game plan isn&#39;t something you have to sit around and plan out. High-value men&#39;s game plan is to simply be themselves. A high-value man is busy and unavailable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, this just so happens to raise the interest level of a lot of women, but it&#39;s not like it&#39;s you trying to do this. Only fake high-value men have to act busy. You should be busy. But being busy and unavailable won&#39;t do it all by itself. You have to have a personality that she likes. A lot of men confuse charisma with the game, but I think there is a dis tinct difference. Your personality is different from the game in the respect that your personality is your personality. You can&#39;t strategize that. Either she likes the words that are coming out, or she doesn&#39;t. There is no right or wrong pe rsonality. It just boils down to taste. The only personality that is universally disliked is insecure. Other than that, eve</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">rything else is a matter of preference. But let&#39;s put that aside; there are different paths you can take to attract and rais e the interest of the women you desire. Understand the best path is to become the best version of yourself and to dev elop an abundance mindset. No matter how corny you may think you are, somewhere there is a woman who would l ove to share your company.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You must understand that only low-value men with a scarcity mindset use a designed game plan to attract women; hi gh- value men simply just are themselves, and even when they meet women who don&#39;t like them for who they are, th ese men have the abundance mindset to keep it moving. The strategies I&#39;m about to layout shouldn&#39;t be strategies at a ll but rather if you&#39;ve been paying attention to this book, a lifestyle. To low-value men who don&#39;t want to do self-imp rovement, then admittedly they are strategies. A lot of men fail with women because they try to use the same game p lan for every woman. When a woman is looking for a relationship, I can all but guarantee you she&#39;ll lose interest if y ou try to reach out once a week to set a date. Women who are seeking relationships tend to pursue, if you&#39;re a man th ey can see themselves within a relationship, to move things along, so to speak.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you don&#39;t reciprocate her pursuit, she&#39;ll just assume you aren&#39;t looking for the same thing she is looking for and mo ve on. If you don&#39;t care about adjusting, then that&#39;s your choice, but just understand you&#39;ll be losing out on a lot of fe male companionship if you know what I mean. If you&#39;re a high-value man with limited time, I understand you may n ot have an hour in your day to chat on the phone, but a simple good-morning text goes a long way here. It doesn&#39;t tak e a whole lot. As I&#39;ve mentioned before, a lot of men have taken my high-value lifestyle way out of context. Just bec ause you&#39;re high-value doesn&#39;t mean you have time for a simple text if the woman is showing genuine interest. Just make sure you let these women know you like to take your time and not to rush into things. Ironically a woman who&#39; s just enjoying her single life loses attraction when a man comes across too strong by reaching out more than once a week to set a date. No woman is attracted to a man who&#39;s actively seeking a relationship, even if the woman prefers a relationship.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She might initially have attraction, but it1l die quickly because a man who&#39;s looking for a relationship comes across subconsciously as a man without many options. Women want to feel like they had to win you over from all your ma ny options of women. The way to avoid this is by not over pursuing. This can be done accidentally because you fall i nto the trap of her pursuing, so you might tend to overdo it. There&#39;s a fine line between under pursuing and over purs uing. I accept the risk of leaving a lot of female companionship on the table because at this point, sleeping with as m any women as I possibly can is no longer my focus. I&#39;m more concerned with my purpose in life than to worry about sleeping with a wide variety of women anymore, and that&#39;s what being high value is truly about. God&#39;s truth is, if yo ur main goal is to sleep with as many women as you possibly can, the best method to accomplish that is to play the n umbers game all day every day.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The numbers game is when you approach as many women as you possibly can on any given day and hope you meet some women who like you. Being a high- value man will never be the best method to sleep with the most women. Y ou simply don&#39;t spend enough time pursuing women. Being a high value is about losing your addiction to women. B eing high value is about no longer letting your little head allow you to be manipulated by women. Just understand I&#39; m writing this book for the sole purpose of helping not just my red-pill brothers but also my purple-pill brothers who accept female nature for what it is and choose to engage in a monogamous relationship.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;m not here to judge anyone, as I&#39;m a firm believer in different strokes for different folks. By default, if you&#39;re famili ar with my work and teachings, you&#39;re automatically purple or red pill. There&#39;s no way you can be familiar with my work and consider yourself a blue pill. Charisma is subjective, but if you&#39;re dating a woman whom charisma-wise yo u just don&#39;t do it for, you still have a card you can play. You can just shut the hell up!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For men who think they have no charisma, you must understand that you don&#39;t need charisma. If the woman finds yo u attractive, the strong, silent type has been and always will be attractive to a lot of women so long as you can at leas t hold a decent conversation. A woman could find you attractive, but if you lack the charisma that she likes to go alo ng with it, then she could lose attraction very quickly. It&#39;s not that you lack charisma, but maybe you lack the charis ma she&#39;s accustomed to. You could always just be silent. Silence is synonymous with being mysterious. Of course, y ou can&#39;t be a mute, but by and large, women find mysterious men attractive so long as these men know what to say when the time comes. The thing with being mysterious is, it only works if a woman finds you attractive.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If a woman doesn&#39;t find you that attractive, being the strong, silent type won&#39;t do much in the way of raising her inter est. If a woman doesn&#39;t find you very attractive, you&#39;re going to need to raise her attraction with your charisma. If ch arisma-wise you&#39;re not compatible, then it simply won&#39;t work, unless she&#39;s looking for a provider and you have your life in order. The rules go as follows: if a woman finds you attractive, then you don&#39;t need compatible charisma so lo ng as you remain mysterious. If a woman doesn&#39;t find you that attractive, then you&#39;re going to have to be compatible in terms of charisma because that&#39;s the only way you can raise her interest to sleep with her unless she&#39;s looking for a provider and you have your stuff together.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re trying to use women&#39;s hypergamous nature against them, you have to have a game plan because women are notorious for using men whom they have no sexual desires for. I really shouldn&#39;t refer to it as a game plan, because i t&#39;s more about rules you should follow when dealing with a woman who perceives you as a beta male. This is why it&#39; s so important to keep the cost of your dates down initially and to stick to the three-date rule. Sticking to those princi ples prevents you from getting played. Materialistic women have a game plan, and it usually revolves around using a man&#39;s sexual desires against him. They do this by dressing in sexy clothes to manipulate as many resources as they can without sleeping with you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some women will sleep with you and then pull back, so you chase her with your wallet in the hope of sleeping with her again. If you&#39;re the type to use a woman&#39;s hypergamous nature against her, you should just keep in mind that thes e are the kinds of women who have the most game, so you have to be on point. The best thing that a man who&#39;s tryin g to use a woman&#39;s nature against her can do is to have a firm timeline for sex to happen. If you don&#39;t, you can find y ourself in a hamster wheel, chasing sex from her for years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 63</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Standing Up to Haters When You&#39;re with Your Girl</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Men are supposed to be protectors of the household. If you have an attractive woman, you can expect men to cross b oundaries when you&#39;re with your woman. Attractiveness is in the eye of the beholder, so even if you consider your w oman average, she might be a dime to someone else, which won&#39;t exclude you from haters&#39; negativity. A great way t o negate a physical or verbal confrontation with haters is to hold a strong masculine frame when you&#39;re with your gir l.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You should hold a masculine frame all the time. Holding a masculine frame might negate some negativity when you&#39; re out and about with your woman, but it won&#39;t stop it entirely. Men love discussing women&#39;s nature but don&#39;t spend any time discussing male nature, which is mainly jealousy. When you&#39;re with your woman, the only reason men try t o disrespect you is their jealousy. They&#39;re trying to emasculate you in front of your girl. If that woman was out and a bout by herself, they probably wouldn&#39;t even say anything to her. Avoiding certain locations that are known for draw ing the wrong crowd might help, but quite frankly, you could be at a restaurant when some asshole disrespects you. So how should you respond if someone does? Well, this is one of those situations where it just depends on how muc h your self-respect matters to you. If it&#39;s me, I&#39;m standing up for myself every time. Could the guy have a weapon?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most certainly he could, but as a man, my self-respect matters more to me than anything. I can assure you right now that if you don&#39;t stand up for yourself, there will be a lot of sleepless nights. Being emasculated can have an everlasti ng effect. Years can pass, and you could still be living with that shame. If you don&#39;t stand up for yourself, you shoul d expect your woman to lose a little respect for you. This is mainly due to her not feeling safe when she &#39;s with you. Men are expected to be providers and protectors. There&#39;s a difference between standing up for yourself and acting in secure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A man looking at your woman is not a reason to check a man. Let them look; that&#39;s what you should expect if you th ink highly of your woman. I damn sure don&#39;t want a woman who never turns heads. I generally wait until I hear som ething disrespectful before I react. Some men are so brazen that they&#39;ll even go as far as to grab your woman. This is a rare situation, but it does happen. Never resort to violence unless it&#39;s in self-defense. You have to learn how to sta nd up for yourself without initiating physical contact. You can simply say something like, &quot;Hey, dude. Don&#39;t disresp ect me and my girl like that.&quot; A response like that should usually do the trick because most of these individuals who</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">engage in that type of behavior are cowards. Cowards usually try to find individuals they perceive as weaker to pick on. This makes them feel better about themselves. Be warned that some of these individuals might escalate the situat ion. If it&#39;s me, I only resort to violence to defend myself. So if they make you feel threatened, you have every human right to defend yourself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 64</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When to Buy Women Gifts and What to Get</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Every man who&#39;s in a relationship is always confused as to what to get his woman for her birthday or Christmas. Yo u can buy a woman&#39;s gifts for Valentine&#39;s if you prefer, but forValentine&#39;s Day, I prefer to do something romantic lik e dinner and a bubble bath. If you&#39;re in a non-monogamous relationship, you&#39;re probably wondering if you should ge t her anything at all. Well, if that&#39;s your scenario, then it depends on a host of variables. Those variables include, but are not limited to, the amount of time the two of you have been dating, whether she is buying you something, and he r interest level, which is directly correlated to her cooperation. I&#39;m not buying an uncooperative woman-that is, a low</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-interest woman-anything, regardless of how long we&#39;ve been dating.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Quite frankly, at this point in my life, I don&#39;t care how good the sex is; to me, an uncooperative woman and I won&#39;t b e dating very long at all. For hard-core red-pill men who don&#39;t believe in buying women gifts, then you must underst and that every woman wants to feel appreciated from time to time. Now, if you&#39;re a pump-and-dump kind of guy, th en this book isn&#39;t for you at all. I&#39;m writing this book more for men who like rotations and men who are in relationsh ips, whether it&#39;s monogamous or non-monogamous. I consider a rotation to be dating the same women, not a constan t revolving door. Sleeping with women is nothing; it&#39;s more work to maintain the attention of several women. Men t ake everything to the extreme. Men tend to be either beta simps or Ike Turner hard. As I&#39;ve mentioned before, balanc e is the key. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with buying women gifts for their birthday or Christmas, but I do see someth ing wrong with buying women&#39;s random gifts for no reason at all.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Essentially, you&#39;re putting her on a pedestal and subconsciously conveying to her that this is what you have to do to keep her happy. You alone should be enough to keep her happy. A universal gift I&#39;ve found to always work is a purs e or bag. The brand of this purse depends on what brand your woman prefers. You can find this out by simply payin g attention to what brands she carries when you&#39;re with her. If it&#39;s a brand that&#39;s not in your budget, then try to get a b rand that&#39;s classy and plain. You generally can&#39;t go wrong with a plain purse. Remember, it&#39;s the thought that counts, but don&#39;t be a cheapskate either. Another good gift I&#39;ve observed that works is high heels. The same rules apply here</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">, as I recommend getting a brand she wears often. In both situations, you want to make sure it&#39;s a style she doesn&#39;t alr eady have. Although it&#39;s the thought that counts, you want to make sure it&#39;s a brand she likes because if it is, then she &#39;s more likely to wear it. Nobody likes to buy someone something that they never use or wear.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 65</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why I&#39;m So against the Direct Approach</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;ve gotten some flak from some men who don&#39;t like my stance on the direct approach. The biggest issue I have with using a direct approach is that it&#39;s outdated. We live in a different world than we did when this tactic was first introd uced. We live in a world where everything a man does is considered sexual harassment. I mean, if you look at a wo man wrong, it&#39;s sexual harassment; how are you supposed to openly talk sexually to a woman then? I think it&#39;s irresp onsible for anyone to teach young men, or old men for that matter, to use this technique when it can get them fired fr om their job, expelled from school, or get charged with sexual harassment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I understand that it&#39;s not all sexual talk, but if someone misuses this technique, it can have lasting consequences on t heir career and livelihood. I wrote about this in my first book, but I feel so passionate about this that I felt compelled to discuss it again, as it&#39;s not only a poor technique to use but also an irresponsible one. Men who teach a direct appr oach show you that their more direct approach is just like anything else when a man is trying to obtain sex from wo men, and that&#39;s a strategy, and just like every other strategy, it&#39;s going to work on some women, while on others it w on&#39;t. The only woman this approach is going to work on is the women who view you as an alpha male or the women with very high initial interest. That alone lets you know this is more of a gimmick than an actual strategy. I would gu ess that 90 to 95 percent of the women who view you are going to have an average to low initial interest level. That</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">means that you&#39;ll only be able to sleep with 5 percent of the women you meet.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s a very low percentage. Even a novice could sleep with 20 percent of the women he meets. When I was in the f itness industry, you see a lot of lose-weight-fast gimmicks and gadgets, and that&#39;s exactly what using a direct approa ch with a woman you&#39;ve just met is a gimmick. I understand that using a direct approach is about not letting women take advantage of you. It also suggests that women are as visual as men. Be this as it may, I still say it&#39;s a flawed stra tegy because women are not as visual as men. Looks do matter to women, so I don&#39;t want to cast that illusion that th ey don&#39;t matter, but they don&#39;t matter nearly as much as they do to men. When you use a direct approach, you lose a man&#39;s greatest asset, and that&#39;s the ability to raise a woman&#39;s interest with your personality, confidence, and strength. If you don&#39;t remember anything else that I tell you, just remember this one saying: &quot;Everyone wants something out t he deal.&quot; Men have sex because we want a sexual release.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Women have sex to have a sexual release also, but most women can&#39;t cum during sex unless they have direct clitoral stimulation, so most women accept the fact that they won&#39;t get the same enjoyment from sex as men do. Another wa y women can cum is when they&#39;re emotionally attached to you,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you wanted to sleep with other women, then why not just stay a bachelor? The reason is simple: scarcity. I also ref er to men who cheat as the world&#39;s biggest cockblockers. The reason I use this term is that men knowingly get into monogamous relationships to prevent the woman they&#39;re in a relationship with from sleeping with other men. They want to have their cake and eat it too. Instead of just dating the woman, which would undoubtedly leave the woman available to sleep with other men, you took the coward&#39;s route and committed just to prevent her from sleeping with other men, despite that not being what you truly wanted to do.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: -3pt;text-align: left;">Another great time to use a direct approach is when you&#39;re on vacation. When you&#39;re on vacation, there&#39;s a very good chance you won&#39;t have time to raise a woman&#39;s interest, so you have nothing to lose by using a more direct approach</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">. However, if you have time to raise her interest, essentially having a direct approach is a lack of confidence in your game. You&#39;re saying, &quot;I have no confidence in my ability to raise your interest with my game and charm, so I need t o know right now if you have enough physical attraction to me to sleep with me, or else I&#39;ll just be wasting my time. &quot; Game, in a nutshell, is your strategy to raise a woman&#39;s interest so she&#39;ll feel attracted to you. Understand, however</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">, that even in those situations, you run the risk of getting charged with sexual harassment if you approach the wrong female.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 66</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Getting into a Relationship with a Woman You Took from Another Guy</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All is fair in love and war. That saying simply means it&#39;s every man for himself. When women start losing interest in a man they&#39;re dating or in a relationship, they&#39;ll usually start to pull back before the relationship ends. During this pu llback, the woman may start dating other men or, at the very minimum, start giving out her contact information. Whi le I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to date a married woman, I see nothing wrong with dating a woman who&#39;s just in a relations hip, but to be honest, it&#39;s all the same. Just be aware of the little thing called karma if you decide to go that route.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When a woman wants to cheat but keeps her beta-male provider at home, she&#39;ll usually inform you of the situation s o you know how to play your position. If a woman is ready to move on, likely, she won&#39;t even tell you she&#39;s involve</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">d. Generally speaking, you should be able to tell if you&#39;re dating a woman who&#39;s in a relationship just by her patterns of behavior. She&#39;ll be very inconsistent in her behavior, and you won&#39;t be able to get ahold of her for hours on end. Some women go the extra mile to avoid getting caught, so in those situations, you may never know if a woman is in a relationship with someone else unless she tells you or they&#39;re living together. The reason for this is that&#39;s just how women move on.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Guys must understand that a lot of what I teach I just got from my observations of how women behave. I don&#39;t want men acting like women, but I do want mento to develop the abundance mindset that women have. When women go out, they aren&#39;t looking to pick up men from the club. They&#39;re there to just enjoy themselves. I&#39;m trying to get men to adopt that same mindset. Women keep men in the friend zone to serve their self-serving needs of constant validatio n and, in some cases, to have as a backup plan. I teach men to keep women in the friend zone for the same reasons. I</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;text-align: left;">know a lot of men won&#39;t like that last statement because they have oneitis and fear other men sleeping with their wo man, but men have to start seeing the world for how it is and not for how they want to see it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These are the same men who are confused as to how their woman just lost attraction all of a sudden, but if they had been paying attention, they would&#39;ve noticed she had been pulling back for weeks, if not months. Who knows? May be you took another man&#39;s girl and just didn&#39;t know. Women are rarely ever completely single, so there&#39;s a very good chance when you started dating her that she was involved with someone else and pulled back to be with you. If you knowingly start dating a woman in a relationship, and the relationship grows to where she&#39;s pushing for a relationshi p with you, I would advise against getting into a monogamous relationship with these kinds of women. I&#39;m a big pro ponent of the law of attraction, and therefore karma will eventually come back to bite you in the behind big time. Yo u&#39;ll be the one on the heartbreak side this time. I&#39;ve dated women in relationships, but the difference is that I never ge t attached; therefore, I&#39;m not afraid of karma coming back at me. If you&#39;re a hard-core red-pill guy, then you don&#39;t ha ve this concern, but if you&#39;re a purple-pill guy, you should keep these women off-limits for a relationship. These kin ds of women don&#39;t have the decency to end things with you before moving on.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 67</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s Her Frame of Mind, Not Her Interest Level</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Occasionally you may encounter a woman who just does it for you in every way, but despite her obvious high-intere st level, things don&#39;t seem to be progressing the way you think they should. While I don&#39;t believe anyone should be l ooking for a relationship, there will come a time it is gone. Just keep in mind that the relationship always moves at t he woman&#39;s pace. So if things aren&#39;t progressing, it&#39;s because she doesn&#39;t want things to progress.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The reason she isn&#39;t pursuing you more or asking to see you more is that she&#39;s not in the mind-set of having anything more than just casual sex or dating without a commitment, which usually means she&#39;s dating other men; however, th at may not always be the case. She could just be enjoying her freedom as a single woman, or she literally might be sl eeping with 5 or six other dudes. It&#39;s&#39; virtually impossible to raise a woman&#39;s interest you&#39;re a purple-pill guy when y ou&#39;re dating a woman and may want things to be a little more exclusive once you&#39;ve caught feelings, so to speak. On e of the reasons she might be avoiding exclusivity is women can sense when a man is more into them than they are i nto him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When a woman senses this, it lowers her attraction because of the challenge of obtaining his validation to the level w here she wants more exclusivity until she&#39;s in the right frame of mind for more exclusivity. You could be doing ever ything right, and she still won&#39;t pursue more because she&#39;s enjoying her freedom. I know this because there&#39;s nothing a woman could do to make me want a relationship right now, no matter how sexy or feminine she is. I&#39;m not lookin g for anything more than casual dating at the moment, so my guard is up, so to speak. By my guard being up, I&#39;m si mply referring to the fact that I take all preventive measures against getting attached, like seeing a woman no more t han twice a week, preferably once, never dating just one woman at a time, and never giving a woman lots of my non sexual attention. When a woman has her guard up, you&#39;ll see some of these similar things. This is not by accident; sh e&#39;s deliberately holding back to prevent getting attached. When someone&#39;s guard is up, only they can take it down.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Them letting their guard down has more to do with them being tired of the game than with their interest in you. In ot her words, when they&#39;re tired of juggling multiple people or want something more meaningful, then they&#39;ll be open t o the possibility of a relationship. As with anything in life, it&#39;s mostly timing. A woman could be with a man for ten years, and the man could be unwillingly to marry her. She decides to finally move on, or they just break up because t he relationship ran its course, and low and behold, six months later, he&#39;s married.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, this could just be a case of the man not thinking the previous woman was marriage material, but sometimes it could just be a case of the man maturing with time. Another thing to consider in those types of situations is the man might&#39;ve learned from his previous experience of losing one good woman, and now he has cold feet and doesn&#39;t wan t it to happen again. Women can enjoy dating more than men due to their wide variety of choices, whereas most men simply don&#39;t have as many options to date as many women as women do with men. When women go through what most of us men refer to in the manosphere as the &quot;slut phase,&quot; there&#39;s nothing you can do to make her want to progre ss things. You need to accept that, or she&#39;s going to start feeling your energy and feel you want more than she&#39;s willi</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ng to give at the moment. A man should never try to progress things because it&#39;an attraction killer to women.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 68</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women Don&#39;t Respect Apologies</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I firmly believe that a man should never apologize to a woman. Not only do most women consider this a sign of wea kness, but women are notorious for playing the victim. They do this by crying amid an argument to draw sympathy f rom a man, even when they&#39;re in the wrong. In giving this sympathy, a man would usually apologize to the woman. I n doing so, the man has just shown the woman how to manipulate him. Start an argument, drop a few tears, and voil a, the man starts to apologize.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Now understand that I&#39;m taking this from the perspective that the man hasn&#39;t done anything wrong. If you&#39;ve forgotte n your anniversary, got caught cheating, or called your woman out her name, then, yes, apologize. I&#39;m taking the per spective that your woman has taken some minuscule disagreement and turned it into this big disagreement. This is th en followed by tears to draw sympathy. So what started as a disagreement over where to vacation this year has turne d into this big, blowout fight and her crying.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you apologize because you had an opinion on this issue, you can expect this same behavior next time this kind of discussion comes around. Some men are familiar with women&#39;s manipulation, but a lot of men don &#39;t understand wh y women use manipulation tactics like crying during an argument. The answer is quite simple, however: it&#39;s to get th eir way. Men are blessed with more strength and drive due to testosterone, which on a level playing field inhibits wo men from competing from a physical standpoint, but from a psychological standpoint, women are far ahead of men because they&#39;re master manipulators. The funny thing is that women aren&#39;t attracted to men they can manipulate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Letting a woman manipulate you is a sign of weakness and scarcity. If you&#39;re in the mindset of abundance, and a wo man tries to run her manipulation, it won&#39;t work because you have no fear of loss. Manipulation tactics only work if you fear losing the woman. The manipulation tactics are to make you afraid of losing her, which causes you to chase or apologize unnecessarily. In other words, women-only try to manipulate men who they perceive as beta males.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A woman instinctively knows she can&#39;t manipulate a man she perceives as an alpha male because he&#39;s in the mindset of abundance. A high-value man would never let a woman manipulate him because if things aren&#39;t progressing or g oing according to his program, he&#39;s out. When a woman puts a man in the friend zone, she&#39;s essentially using the ma n for attention and validation by manipulating the man&#39;s sexual desires. That is why a woman can&#39;t sleep with a man who&#39;s in her friend zone. She doesn&#39;t respect you because you&#39;re too easily manipulated and in obvious scarcity. No w, you do have a different friend was a woman could put you in. There&#39;s the friend zone where you have a chance, a nd you&#39;re the guy on standby. You&#39;re the guy she&#39;s going to run to in the event her current situation goes south.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can tell if you&#39;re in this position because she may or may not go out with you but won&#39;t sleep with you. Her beh avior may also be very inconsistent. There&#39;s also the friend zone where you have no chance unless you increase your status, and you&#39;re relegated to being her gay male girlfriend. You can increase your status by making more money (f inancial status), dating a more attractive woman (sexual market value), and being more popular (social status).In any case, either one of these situations is ideal, as you never know how long that standby, friend-zone position can last, and it takes time to raise your status. Men with options don&#39;t have time to be friends with a woman in the hope of gai ning sex.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If you&#39;re one of these men in a relationship with a woman, and she pulls out the old crying-tears bull crap, you&#39;re not in a scarcity mindset, so the thought of her getting upset and leaving doesn&#39;t concern you one bit. For the genuine ni ce guys out there, being a nice guy and a pushover are two different things. Being nice is holding doors open for old people and saying thank you to people who just did you a service.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Being nice has nothing to do with being easily manipulated by a woman or being taken advantage of by others. If yo u want to maintain the attraction of a woman, you need to make sure she keeps respecting you. A woman can&#39;t respe ct a man whom she&#39;s easily able to manipulate. Don&#39;t confuse respect with appreciation. A woman appreciates the m en in her friend zone, but this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean she respects them. I appreciated my auntie letting me and my</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;text-align: left;">brother getting away with murder, but I respected my uncle more because he was strict. So a woman would undoubt edly appreciate you apologizing and letting her have her way, but that doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;ll respect you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 69</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s All Tricking</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;ve heard throughout my life from a variety of men that dating women is just another form of tricking or prostitution</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">. Men who say this are men who are trying to feel better about themselves paying for sex. These men fail to realize t hat once you&#39;ve become a high-value man, sex is more about the accomplishment than it is about sexual release. In o ther words, sex feels better when you&#39;ve earned it, rather than just have it. This is why men rarely get into relationshi ps with women they have sex with right away. Yeah, a man might appreciate the easy sex, but it just doesn&#39;t have th e same value as it does with a woman who made you wait three or 4 dates. In that respect, men are a walking contra diction, just like women. We love when women give us sex easily, but then we usually lose attraction right away. Th is is the same scenario as when a woman loves when a man compliments her and just openly gives his validation aw ay, but when you do, she loses interest. I guess you can say both sexes don&#39;t know what they want.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you&#39;re having sex with a woman you have a high attraction to for the very first time, there&#39;s this feeling of vict ory that comes over you. That feeling of victory comes from having to &quot;play your cards right,&quot; so to speak, to sleep with her. Having sex with a woman who you have a high attraction to and made you earn it feels like We all know h ow complicated women can be at times, and there are no sure things when it comes to women. They lose interest at t he drop of a hat. A woman could be all over you on the first date and flaking on the third date. I think every man wh o&#39;s dealt with his fair share of women can attest to losing some women who had crazy-high initial interest, so when y ou do get to sleep with a woman for the first time, there&#39;s this sense of accomplishment. I don&#39;t care what any man sa ys; when a woman makes you wait a little longer, it feels even better. That&#39;s because she made you work for it. As h umans, we all appreciate things more when we have to wait for them. While I do believe we appreciate things more i f we have to wait or work for them, my timeline with sex is always three dates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;m willing to go one more date if I think I was close to sealing the deal on the third date. That has more to do with me trying to avoid dating a woman who&#39;s using me for my time and validation. Where does the sense of accomplish ment come from when you pay for sex? I mentioned earlier how I also like female companionship. I like spending ti me with females. The old saying is &quot;You don&#39;t pay a prostitute for sex. You pay her to leave.&quot; That saying implies th at these sorts of men don&#39;t like female companionship. My response to that would be &quot;Then who do you like spendin g time with? Men?&quot; Of course, I know married men or men in monogamous relationships pay prostitutes for the con venience of not having to spend time with them and to avoid getting caught, but there are a lot of single men who pr actice this same philosophy. The reason single men don&#39;t like female companionship is that they don&#39;t know how to handle women. I&#39;ll be the first to admit that women can be a handful if you don&#39;t know how to handle them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Men simply don&#39; t know how to make women behave. A strong masculine frame and consequences for her actions ar e always the remedy for female behavior. I also have to mention this: women who sell their bodies disgust me. A lot of women who sell their bodies just come across to me as having bad hygiene, or at least that&#39;s how it comes across i n the movies. Proper female hygiene is of utmost importance to me, and just the thought of sleeping with a woman with bad hygiene leaves a bad taste in my mouth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 70</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Overcoming Insecurities</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I teach men to follow their purpose to obtain the lifestyle they want. This has more to do with filling that void we all have as opposed to just making more money, but making more money is usually a by-product of getting on your pur pose, so we&#39;ll take it. Making more money usually provides men with more confidence because the average man sub consciously knows women love security to some degree, but making more money doesn&#39;t compensate for insecuritie</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">s. Some men have a hard time obtaining confidence despite making more money or getting into better shape physica lly. This is mainly due to some underlying insecurities. A man can have insecurities about his finances or body, but t hose are insecurities that he can control. You can get a skill to make more money, or you can hit the gym to lose wei ght, but how about the insecurities you can&#39;t control, like a thinning hairline, being short, or having a crooked nose?</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To be fair, you could get your thinning hairline or crooked nose fixed with cosmetic surgery, but let&#39;s just assume co smetic surgery isn&#39;t something you&#39;re willing to do or can afford at the moment. So how is a man with insecurities ab out himself supposed to genuinely feel confident?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The answer is to learn to accept your insecurities. You must understand that no one is perfect; we all have flaws we wish we could change. Look at how many women today are having cosmetic surgeries. Cosmetic surgery used to be something only wealthy people could afford, but not any longer. Pretty much every Instagram model or stripper has had some kind of cosmetic surgery done. This is because cosmetic surgery has become so affordable now. Women h aving cosmetic surgery is showing you all the insecurities they&#39;ve always had but couldn&#39;t do anything about until no</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">w. I don&#39;t speak very articulately, and I have a receding hairline that caused me to go bald at an early age. It never af fected me because I knew everyone has something they were dealing with and not just me. Women might assume yo u have an insecurity about something and test your confidence with some simple trolling. If you don&#39;t respond negati vely to her trolling, then she&#39;ll just leave it alone because she notices that through trolling, her assumption was incorr ect.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This doesn&#39;t just apply to women; this also applies to people in general. They&#39;ll test you, but if you handle it correctl y, they&#39;ll just leave it alone. You handle trolling by not getting overly emotional and trolling back in a non-defensive way. Whenever you want to bitch and complain about small, insignificant insecurities, just keep in mind some peop le would trade places with you in a heartbeat. You may be short due to your mom and pop&#39;s genetics, but there&#39;s alw ays someone short due to not having legs. Sometimes we get so caught up in worrying about what we don&#39; t have tha t we forget to be thankful for what we do have. No amount of self-improvement will cover for your insecurities. The only remedy is to accept your flaws and just know everyone has them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 71</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Respect over Perception</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Confirming dates have long been considered something that high-value men shouldn&#39;t do. It makes you look like a g uy who&#39;s accustomed to women flaking on him. Unfortunately, today we live in the social media age where it&#39;s more difficult than ever to maintain a woman&#39;s interest. Thanks to social media, women have the attention span of two-ye ar-olds. Women aren&#39;t the only ones with short attention spans. Men also have short attention spans, as I know, spea king for myself, it&#39;s hard for me to concentrate on a TV show without glancing at my phone or social media profiles only to look up lost as to what&#39;s going on with the TV show. This short attention span has created a flaking phenome non today like no other. This phenomenon forced me to create a technique that allows y</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That hour or two it took me to get dressed and commute to the date location means more to me than any woman&#39;s pe rception of me would ever mean. I&#39;m well aware that some women might speculate that you&#39;re confirming a date by sending the location the morning of the date, or she may even make other plans since you withheld the location and she thought you flaked on her, but my top priority is to always to put my purpose first. Once you become a high-val ue man, a woman&#39;s perception of you is not the top priority, which is why you check her when you feel she is disres pecting you. Some men argue that checking a woman who is seemingly flirting with other men in their face is a sign of insecurity. I disagree wholeheartedly; my self-respect will always mean more to me than a woman&#39;s perception of me. Women will do things like text or talk on their phones on the date. As a man, you&#39;re damned if you do and dam ned if you don&#39;t, so you might as well let her know what type of behavior won&#39;t be tolerated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 72</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hypergamy Isn&#39;t Just More Money</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re in a monogamous relationship, your girl is inevitably going to have a girls night out from time to time. If yo u&#39;re a confident man, this shouldn&#39;t be an issue. You must understand that no woman is ever truly off the market, and if she so happens to meet a man whom she has a high interest in, she&#39;ll undoubtedly give him her number - unless sh e views you as an alpha male who is doing everything right. I firmly believe that as long as a man whom a woman vi ews as an alpha male is doing everything right, a woman will be too busy chasing his validation to cheat. I can&#39;t tell you how many women I&#39;ve met over the years who lived with their boyfriend or husband. Some even informed me t hat I couldn&#39;t call them to avoid the boyfriend catching them. A lot of times, I had nothing going for myself financial</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ly, so this was mainly physical attraction-that is, the women view me as an alpha male. The lack of financial success would&#39;ve made me a sexual alpha at that point in my life. The secret to avoiding this is to always be the woman&#39;s be st option, and even that might not be enough. The thing about being a purple-pill guy is that you&#39;re aware of the fem ale nature, and you&#39;ve signed up to take the risk.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women are hypergamous, but this isn&#39;t just limited to finances. Hypergamy covers all aspects of dating. It simply m eans a woman trades up, but this isn&#39;t limited to trading up for a better financial situation. I&#39;ve known women to leav e men who were way more financially secure for guys who simply were hotter to them. This lets me know hyperga my isn&#39;t just relegated to finances but rather to what the woman values the most. For instance, a woman might marry or be in a relationship with a man who&#39;s a better provider only to leave him for a guy she finds more attractive. Som e women value sex appeal over financial stability. So if you&#39;re a guy who makes a lot of money, don&#39;t think a man w ho makes far less than you do is incapable of taking your woman. Remember, attraction isn&#39;t just physical appearanc e but rather sex appeal as a whole. Hypergamy also dictates which male a woman wants to replicate. The top priority of sex is reproduction, not pleasure. When a woman sees a man whom she finds very attractive and confident, whic h are indicators of strength, she instinctively wants to reproduce with him. The thing is, some women value finances over sex appeal, while some women value sex appeal over finances. Women who value finances over sex appeal wo uld never leave a man of means for sex appeal, but they would cheat, while a woman who values sex appeal over fin ances would leave you once she&#39;s convinced you want something more than just sex. Of course, all of this is null and void if you&#39;re in a relationship with a woman who views you as an alpha male. Outside of the pimp, the ultimate ma le in the hierarchy is always the all-around alpha. You may ask, &quot;Why would the woman get into a relationship with a man she didn&#39;t find that appealing, to begin with?&quot; Well, maybe he was the best she could do at the time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That&#39;s the same reason you dated a woman you perceived as a seven for 4 years even though you knew she didn&#39;t kn ock your socks off, so to speak or the same reason you worked that mediocre job you hated for eight years until you found a better job. A lot of people have the motto that &quot;something is better than nothing,&quot; and while I agree with this motto, when it comes to having a job, because we all have bills and responsibilities, I can&#39;t say I agree with it when it comes to my dating life, because the more time you spend dating a woman you really aren&#39;t that into, the less time you have to meet that woman you really are into. This is why I always advise men to never date women they don&#39;t h ave a crazy-high initial interest in because the in time you&#39;re spending dating them, you could be out living a social li fe of abundance and meeting women you have a high attraction for. Just think of how many times you&#39;ve gone on a date with a woman you met online only to find out she looks nothing like her pictures.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That time could have been better spent hanging out and socializing with women you have a high attraction to. As a r ed-pill man who&#39;s not looking to get into a committed relationship anytime soon, I don&#39;t have these concerns, as I un derstand the female nature and choose not to deal with this. Purple- pill men, however, agree to take on these risks a nd must understand that when a woman goes out with her friends, you&#39;re always at the mercy of circumstances. To b e honest, it doesn&#39;t have to be a girls&#39; night out; it could just be her going to the grocery store. The fact of the matter i s, making the relationship official with a woman won&#39;t protect you from the female nature. Most men try to put a rin g on it or make it official to prevent other men from sleeping with their girl when in actuality all you have done is a narrower pool of prospects. Since you&#39;re in a relationship, she might not give that guy she perceives as a six on a sca le of one to ten her number now that she is in a relationship like she would have before you two became official, but she&#39;s definitely going to give that guy she views as a ten her number if she&#39;s the kind that values sex appeal. The sam e holds in the finance department. She might not give that guy who looks like he makes less than you her number if she&#39;s a woman who&#39;s big on finances, but if she encounters a man she perceives as having more wealth than you, she certainly would give him her number or take him - unless she perceives you as an alpha male. Remember, how a wo man views you is subject to change at any given moment. Just because she views you as an alpha male today won&#39;t mean she will next week. All this comes with the territory when you&#39;re the purple pill.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When a woman does have a girls&#39; night out, you should never call to check up on her. It1l only lower her attraction, and quite frankly, it won&#39;t stop anything, as women are far better at planning than men when it comes down to infide lity. You should never ask her the next day what she and her girls did or where they went the previous night, as it&#39;ll o nly make you look insecure. Women are going to do what they want to do, and there&#39;s not much you really can do ab out it. It&#39;s quite possible that her going out is a test, and she wants to see how you handle it. You should always carry yourself as though you&#39;re her best option; therefore, you&#39;re not concerned. When you act insecure and jealous, you&#39;r</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e subconsciously sending the signal that you think she can do better, hence why you&#39;re so frightened. Women see thi s type of behavior and think, &quot;If he thinks I can do better, then maybe I can.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Confidence is always an attractive trait when it comes to attracting women, but it&#39;s important tenfold in a relationshi p, as it shows either you genuinely believe you&#39;re entitled to her or you feel like you got lucky. No woman wants to be with a man who feels like he got lucky. Women want to feel like they got lucky unless they&#39;re looking for a provi der. This is the old-women-date-up theory. If she views you as a provider, confidence and charisma don&#39;t matter mu ch to her, as she views you simply as a provider. If a woman views you as a beta provider, your charisma and attracti veness only matter when she compares you to other potential beta-male providers. I won&#39;t say sex appeal doesn&#39;t mat ter to a woman who&#39;s looking for or views you as a beta provider, but let&#39;s just say you don&#39;t have to exactly be a ten in her eyes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 73</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alpha Male Strategies Are Not about Sleeping with the Most Women</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A lot of men are confused as to what I&#39;m all about. Becoming a high-value male is not the best way to attract and sle ep with the most women. If your sole purpose for reading this book is to sleep with the most women possible, then y ou don&#39;t understand what Alpha Male Strategies are all about. The best way to sleep with the most women is to rand omly approach as many women as you possibly can throughout the day. This also would require you to optimize dat ing apps. Although dating apps aren&#39;t the best way to meet women, it is a tool nonetheless. I won&#39;t lie to you and act like becoming a high-value male doesn&#39;t enhance your chances with women, because it does, but a high-value man d oesn&#39;t have time to date a lot of women at once.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From my perspective, a high- value man can only date about three women at a time before the women start to imped e on his purpose in life. Although the high-value man doesn&#39;t have the time to date as many women as the low-value man does, the high-value man is in a much better place mentally because his life&#39;s happiness isn&#39;t dependent on how many women he&#39;s sleeping with at any given moment. Alpha Male Strategies are about learning to live a fulfilling li fe without women, not maximizing how many women you sleep with. The law of averages says that a man who appr oaches a one hundred women a day has a much better chance to attract and sleep with more women than the high-va lue man who&#39;s waiting for choosing signals does, but the guy who&#39;s waiting for choosing signals is in a much better place mentally; he&#39;s built his life to be independent of constant female validation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The guy who&#39;s waiting for choosing signals isn&#39;t waiting for them because he&#39;s afraid of rejection or thinks it&#39;s the be st way to attract women; he&#39;s waiting for choosing signals because he&#39;s content in life. I tell guys regularly that I slep t with more women when I lived in a basement in Brooklyn with a mattress on the floor than I do now that I have a n ice, spacious apartment and am making way more money. The catch, however, was that in the past, I spent most of my time chasing women rather than my passion in life, thus why I was living in a basement. Most men who are over weight with low or no income think that they&#39;re unsuccessful with women due to their situation, but the truth is, you can attract women no matter how broke or overweight you are if you talk to enough women. The thing about becomi ng a high-value male is that your rejection rate greatly decreases, but be that as it may, any man, regardless of incom e, could attract women. The issue with most men who have some kind of insecurity is that they immediately conclud e that no woman wants them after they get just a few rejections. You see, some men let their insecurities, whether it&#39; s height, their financial situation, looks, or weight, deter them from approaching more women because of a few rejec tions. They let rejections put them in a state of scarcity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is very common in men who classify themselves as incels. They just gave up. Most men just don&#39;t have what it takes to withstand a lot of rejections because they take the rejections personally when in reality, rejections have mor e to do with timing than anything. They find my work and immediately think that getting in the gym and pursuing y our purpose in life is just about becoming more attractive to the opposite sex when in actuality, it&#39;s more about beco ming a content man than anything else. When you have a purpose in life, fitness goals, friends, and hobbies, you no l onger value female validation the way you once did because you no longer have so much free time to fill. When me n have a lot of free time on their hands, they usually occupy it by trying to attract women. This energy leaves you fe eling depleted, as no matter how many women you attract, it&#39;ll never be enough. So to be clear, the best way to sleep with the most women is to play the numbers game, but when it&#39;s all said and done, the man who plays the number g</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ame is going to be forever chasing his tail, while the man who&#39;s pursuing his purpose is building a life of contentmen t void of constant female validation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 74</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How to Get a Threesome</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most men&#39;s number one fantasy is to have a threesome. There are a lot of variables that have to line up to achieve ha ving a threesome. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s an exact science to having threesomes, but let&#39;s just say it takes a little luck. For one, you have to have a woman who&#39;s somewhat interested in other women. The reason for this is quite simple: no matter how high a woman&#39;s interest is, she would never do it unless she finds women somewhat attractive. Just us e yourself, for example. If you&#39;re a straight male, are there any circumstances in which you would perform sex acts o n another man to please your woman? The only way you do that is if you found men somewhat attractive or had som e kind of cuckold fetish.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A cuckold is a man who gets off being submissive to his woman. This is where the luck comes into play. You have t o be lucky to find a woman who is either openly bisexual or attracted to women. The next thing you need is extreme ly high attraction and a fear of loss. Women don&#39;t like to share their men even if they are attracted to other women. T his is mainly due to the insecurities a woman has regarding the man being more attracted to the other woman than he is to her. A woman&#39;s fear of losing you has to be greater than her fear of you finding the woman more attractive tha n she is. So once again, you have to have luck on your side and have a woman who isn&#39;t in a state of abundance. You simply can&#39;t give a woman who&#39;s in a state of abundance a fear of loss. If you have a woman who&#39;s in a state of scar city, you might have a chance. You can try to put your woman in a state of scarcity by pulling back, but manipulatio n only works on weak-minded individuals living in scarcity. This is why the fear of loss is so important. So with this understanding, it stands to reason that the only way you&#39;ll achieve a threesome is if you&#39;ve broken up with your girl before so she knows you have no problem doing it again. This leads her to do whatever it takes to keep you. With th at being said, that fear of loss only works on women with some kind of scarcity mindset. Women with a strong sense of self-worth, coupled with an abundance mindset, no matter how high their attraction is to you, would never have a threesome with you unless it&#39;s something they&#39;ve fantasized about also. This is why I say it&#39;s more about luck than a nything else. You need a woman who&#39;s sexually attracted to women, has a fear of loss and has an extremely high int erest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are circumstances where you can have women with an abundance mindset and where you can raise her attracti on so high that she falls into a scarcity mindset, but it&#39;s extremely rare. I say that because I don&#39;t think any woman ca n make me fear to lose her, so it stands to reason that a lot of women could have that same mindset. Understand that scarcity isn&#39;t about finding another man but rather about finding a man like you who just does it for her. The good ne ws is that if you&#39;re a man who fantasizes about having a threesome, the average woman won&#39;t have that kind of abun dance mindset if you&#39;re a guy who just does it for her. This is because women have a much harder time finding men who are perfect for them. Let&#39;s be honest for a minute. Most men today are weak, and by weak, I don&#39;t mean physica lly; I mean mentally. Most women can manipulate the average man, which is not what women want. Women want a man who&#39;s able to say no and walk away if need be. A lot of men are confused as to why women are attracted to the bad boy, but the bad boy has no problem telling a woman no. If you&#39;re dating a woman who views you as a beta mal e, then you shouldn&#39;t even be thinking about a threesome. When you&#39;re dating a woman who views you as a beta mal e, just getting sex on the regular is a challenge.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 75</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How to Organize Your Rotation</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you become a high-value man, it&#39;s very important to have your rotation in order. No longer are you just able to wing it. As a high- value man with limited time, your schedule isn&#39;t flexible at all. It&#39;s your purpose first, and everyt hing else is a distant second. With that being said, you do want to make time to socialize. I typically don&#39;t hang out with men, so in my spare time, I&#39;m usually with women. So which woman do you see and when? Well, this is going to boil down to your schedule, but for me, I give my top girl Sundays. Sunday is typically the day I do the least work</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">; therefore , I have more time available. I prefer not to date women during the week if I&#39;m writing a book, but I&#39;m wil ling to make accommodations if my weekend is booked and I&#39;m genuinely interested in the woman. As the old sayin</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">g goes, &quot;people make time for the things they want to make time for.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve put her ahead of my purpose, but rather I just might not have gotten as much done that particu lar day as I normally would. This is not exactly the end of the world. Saturday goes to the woman I like second best. I typically work half a day on Saturdays, so, therefore, my Saturday girl doesn&#39;t get the same amount of time as my Sunday girl. Working half a day isn&#39;t mandatory on my part. It&#39;s an option I have if I have nothing else to do. This is n&#39;t written in stone, however, as sometimes I take the weekends off completely. That&#39;s an important component to th e equation because as a red-pill man who&#39;s against dating monogamously, I must always have prospects. I&#39;ve been in the game long enough to know nothing lasts forever. A man shouldn&#39;t expect a woman to stay in his rotation forever</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">. At some point, there&#39;s a very good chance that the women in your rotation start to push for a commitment. You mig ht be able to string her along for a while with the old &quot;I like to take my time&quot; speech, but at some point, that&#39;ll proba bly get old.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women know their sexual market value decreases every day, and most of them are too smart to let you waste their p rime sexual-market-value years on hopes and dreams. So as a red-pill man, preferably you want to have other wome n lined up ready to take their place. As a high-value man, your weekdays are most likely off-limits, with some excep tions, and even if they weren&#39;t, some women are only available on the weekend. This is when you should use the tim e before seeing the women in your rotation. Now let&#39;s suppose you didn&#39;t have any women in your rotation, and you&#39; re in the process of achieving that. In that situation, I would try to determine who my high-interest prospects are, as well as who my low-interest prospects are. When I&#39;m referencing interest level, I&#39;m referring to the woman&#39;s interest level in me. I would then weigh her interest level against my interest, and that tells me which woman I would see las t for the evening.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is not an exact science, as I would rather date a woman last for the evening if I had an interest level of ten and h er interest level in me was a six than see a woman last for the day if she had an interest of ten and I only had an inter est level of six. If all things are equal, and I had the same amount of interest in both women, then I&#39;m seeing the one who has the highest interest in me last. I do this because I know I&#39;m closer to sleeping with her compared to the othe r woman.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is a rare occasion, asI&#39;m usually already sleeping with one of the women. So I would date my low-interest prosp ect first, preferably around six o&#39;clock. I would then schedule my second date for around eight thirty. I typically like to keep my dates no longer than an hour unless the chemistry is amazing. In doing so, this extra time means I don&#39;t h ave to rush things if things are going well. Don&#39;t feel bad dating multiple women on the same day, as a lot of women have been doing this for years. Whom do you think they&#39;re texting on the date? Their mother? I can&#39;t believe you fel l for that. Women are notorious for having a man they perceive as alpha come over for a night of sex after you&#39;ve dr opped them off with a full belly of food and drinks you paid for.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Don&#39;t get upset; they&#39;re not in a relationship with you, so they don&#39;t owe you an explanation, but you don&#39;t owe them one either. If you&#39;re a red-pill man, this is the life you chose, and thinking you&#39;re going to sleep around with multiple women while women sit around playing bingo waiting on you is ludicrous. Women always have more sex partners t han men do throughout their lifetime. Look it up.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 76</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hating Friends in a Relationship</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women value their friends&#39; opinions of the men that they date. Men do also to a lesser degree. Both sexes do this bec ause we all subconsciously know that the individual was dating has a direct impact on our status as a whole. Women put more emphasis on their friends&#39; opinions because they&#39;re always competing with their friends subconsciously, a nd the same can be said for men. Outside of the optics, what I&#39;ve learned about a woman&#39;s friends&#39; and family&#39;s perce ption of you just depends on what she tells them. Now, sometimes the person you are could cause them to lose attrac tion, maybe because you are unemployed, financially unstable, alcoholic, or verbally abusive. Putting those situation s aside, it&#39;s usually the woman&#39;s portrayal of you that causes her friends and family to not like you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There&#39;s not much you can do to influence your woman&#39;s portrayal of you regardless of how you treat her because so</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">me women love to play the victim. They&#39;re so innocent, and you&#39;re so bad. Some men do this with their families too. If you&#39;re in this situation, just know that you have to make a choice. You can either leave the relationship, as these s ituations can become very uncomfortable depending on how much her friends and family come around, or you can j ust keep your distance. Most of you would probably choose to keep your distance since it&#39;s not her family you&#39;re slee ping with overnight. If you&#39;re in a situation where her friends and family just don&#39;t like you for the person you are, ju st keep in mind that if a woman has a high-enough interest, there&#39;s nothing anybody alive could tell her to cause her t o want to leave you. If she&#39;s the stubborn type, it could cause her to dig in just that much harder to rebel.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 77</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avoiding False Rape Accusations</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Before I get started with this chapter, I want to state for the record that there is not a 100% surefire way to prevent fa lse rape accusations. Trying to get you locked up for something you didn&#39;t do is just wrong, and karma will be a calli ng on this evil woman. Just understand that the more women you sleep with, the greater the chance of you being acc used falsely of rape. With that said, there are some measures you can do to limit the possibility. For starters, you hav e to understand that no means no. &quot;No&quot; doesn&#39;t mean &quot;try harder.&quot; Now, during the seduction phase, when there&#39;s a v ery good chance you might hear &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; When you hear those words, you should stop immediately. This doe sn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t try again later, but whenever she says to stop, you should stop - no questions asked. Sometimes i t&#39;s not that she doesn&#39;t want to have sex but rather that you&#39;re moving too quickly before she&#39;s ready.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whatever the case, just to be on the safe side, you should stop. When you try to progress things too quickly with wo men, they&#39;ll slow you down to the speed they&#39;re comfortable with. You&#39;ll know when to stop completely because she&#39; ll say &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;no&quot; in an angry or irritated tone. She might leave the situation altogether if you&#39;ve made her uncomf ortable. If that&#39;s the case, you&#39;ve likely blown any chance of sleeping with her in the future. You should almost expe ct women to put up some kind of resistance when engaging in sex with you for the first time. These are&#39;.you re tryin g to create an opportunity for sex, objections she&#39;s having within herself. If she&#39;s put herself in a position for you to s educe her, and you&#39;re patient, there&#39;s a good chance sex will take place, but you should never force it. Always err on the side of caution if you&#39;re unsure of her temperament. You should never sleep with an inebriated or intoxicated wo man.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">At that point, a woman can&#39;t give you consent of her own free will. A glass of wine doesn&#39;t cause a woman to becom e inebriated, as I advise meeting women for a drink to keep date prices down-but a few shots of Hennessy will. Let&#39;s not kid ourselves here; every man, if he&#39;s being honest with himself, knows when a woman is not in control of her fa culties. If you had to carry the woman into the house, I think it&#39;s very likely she&#39;s unable to give consent. My rule her e is when in doubt, don&#39;t sleep with her. I don&#39;t care if you do feel this may be your only opportunity. It&#39;s just not wo rth it in my book. If you&#39;re a single man, in a perfect world, you truly shouldn&#39;t be obligated to contact a woman agai n after sleeping with her. While this is true, we aren&#39;t living in a perfect world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ghosting a woman after sex, especially if she liked you, can cause her to seek revenge. While most women aren&#39;t thi s spiteful, some women will go as far as to get you locked up if you treat them this way. I&#39;ve ghosted women but nev er right after sex. I deliberately converse back and forth with them after sex even if I know full well that I have no in tention of seeing them again. This is to limit the possibility of a woman falsely accusing me. A woman scorned is a man burned. Sadly, we live in a society where a simple unproven allegation could ruin a man&#39;s life, but that&#39;s what w e&#39;re dealing with. The only thing we as men can do is adapt. I advise you to store all the text messages you have with women. I commonly take screenshots of them and email them to myself to save storage space on my phone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This sounds kind of extreme, but every man thinks it could never happen to them until the day it does. Women legall y extort rich and famous men by threatening a lawsuit that they know would ruin the man&#39;s reputation, therefore cau sing the man to settle out of court to prevent it from going public, and all the while the media protects women&#39;s ident ities. I always found it odd how a man could have potentially raped a woman, and she&#39;s willing to let it go for a few dollars. If someone had done something of that nature to me, I wouldn&#39;t want anything but a stiff prison sentence for them. This fact alone lets us know that a lot of these claims are false.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 78</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Where Will This Social MediaEra End Up?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Everything has a cause and an effect. Social media has changed dating forever. Thanks to social media, every woma n has the attention span of a cockroach. The reason for this is that every day, her inbox is flooded with more thirsty men vying for her sexual companionship. Men are more confused than ever as to how to maintain a woman&#39;s interest in these days of social media. This has caused more and more young men to seek answers via the internet. This thirs t for answers has led more young men, and even older men, to find the red pill. The red pill is when a man is no long er ignorant of the female-male dynamic. This has led more men to become emotionally unavailable. So what&#39;s the re sult? Well, most women at some point mature and want to settle down and start and a family.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">My view is that eventually, over time, there won&#39;t be many men who are willing to settle down to be a provider. For decades now, it&#39;s been commonplace for a woman to have fun in her prime years with men she perceives as alpha m ales only to settle down with a naive beta-male provider who believes the woman is actually in love with him, when in actuality, he&#39;s only a disposable tool to provide for her offspring or potential offspring. Just as women have found free validation online, causing their attention span to decrease, more and more men have found the red pill, causing t hem to not even want monogamous relationships anymore now that they&#39;ve found out about the female nature. Just a s social media has caused more and more men to become frustrated with women, I think that the same social media will cause a lot of female frustration in the long run. You can already find this frustration going on online in the fem ale &quot;dating with a purpose&quot; movement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This movement comes from the frustration some women are already feeling due to an overwhelming majority of me n not wanting anything exclusive since finding out about female nature. This is funny, considering these same men would have been unaware of the female nature had they not first sought out answers as to why it is so hard to get or maintain a woman&#39;s interest in the first place. I expect to see more and more of these &quot;dating with a purpose&quot; groups from women in the future, as most men will probably be red pill by then and not want anything monogamous. If you &#39;re thinking to yourself, &quot;There will always be a beta male waiting for her,&quot; you&#39;re probably right, but what you must understand is that just because a woman has a man doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s necessarily the man she wanted. I think it&#39;s fair to say that we all hate settling for someone less than what we think we deserve.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 79 Leaving a Legacy</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Every man wants to leave something behind so the world knows he existed. This is a natural human desire that most of us instinctively feel. This is usually done by having children. As a red-pill man myself, I&#39;ll openly admit I have th ought about the possibility of having children. You must understand, however, that once you impregnate a woman, y ou no longer have control; she does. Men complain about family court laws, but you have no one to blame but yours elf once you impregnate a woman. The same goes for men who get married. If you want to get married, get married, but don&#39;t complain if you get a divorce and get raped in family court. I quickly quash that notion, as I don &#39;t want to be a paycheck to a woman for the next eighteen years. On top of that, you put yourself in a position for the courts to tell you when you can and can&#39;t see your child. If you want to have children to leave a legacy, I truly understand, as i t&#39;s a natural human instinct. Just don&#39;t complain later if things don&#39;t go your way. I&#39;m about solutions, not bitching an d complaining. There is, however, another way a man can leave a legacy, and that&#39;s with his purpose in life. Jesus C hrist, Isaac Newton, Plato, Beethoven, and George Washington are just a few names of the men who never had child ren, but I bet you&#39;ve heard of every last one of them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That is because they left an impact on society. Their impact on society will probably outlive any family heritage. For any man who finds the red or purple pill, this is always a choice that each one of us must make. If you decide to hav e a child, just understand the courts don&#39;t recognize financial hardships. They only recognize monthly payments. I e mphasize payments, because in my estimation, it&#39;s easier than dealing with most baby mothers. As with anything, th ere are always outliers, but some baby mothers can be a real pain in the ass to the point where it&#39;s easier to just deal with the courts. This is a difficult decision, as most men who want to leave an impact on society won&#39;t quench their desire to leave an heir, and I understand that completely.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chapter 80</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So What&#39;s the End Game?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you&#39;re a red-pill man reading this, you ask yourself, &quot;What does this all lead to?&quot; If you&#39;re a purple-pill man, then your ultimate goal is to find a woman and settle down with. If you&#39;re a red-pill man, it can seem like your life is alwa ys going to be a revolving door of women, leaving you with an empty feeling. I understand that your purpose does h elp tremendously with this, but for some, it still may not be a solution by itself long term. This is why finding the red pill can be a gift and a curse.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The gift is no longer being frustrated when a woman loses interest seemingly from nowhere, and the curse is not bei ng able to let your guard down enough to ever fall completely in love again. You may love a woman again, but to be in love means to trust a woman completely with your emotions, and as a red-pill man, it&#39;s just not possible. It&#39;s sort of like America signing a treaty with North Korea. They may sign the treaty, but they&#39;ll never fully trust one another. The fact of the matter is that an overwhelming majority of men will go purple pill after being red pill. This is mainl y due to a man&#39;s instinct to have a family. It&#39;s not natural for a man to casually sleep around forever. Most men just g ive up and accept women&#39;s flaws and settle down at some point, despite knowing the risk. I&#39;m not here to tell you wh at&#39;s right or wrong; I&#39;m just stating my thoughts and predictions. As for myself, I no longer get joy out of sleeping wi th several dozen women throughout the year anymore. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m going purple pill, but rather I just get more jo y out of my purpose than I ever did sleeping around with random women. At the same time, I do enjoy female comp anionship, which is why a steady rotation of two to three women works wonders for me. This provides enough varie ty while simultaneously providing me with female companionship when needed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever go purple pill, as the mere thought of sleeping with the same woman for an extended period ma kes me nauseous, but that&#39;s just me; every man doesn&#39;t have that same issue. Most men&#39;s biggest issue going purple p ill will be trusted. Most red-pill men will never trust again but would rather settle for the lesser of two evils. That&#39;s c hoosing between being heartbroken and never experiencing anything meaningful with a woman again. Most men ha ve no choice in the matter, as their scarcity mindset and limiting beliefs in themselves have relegated them to accept their role as a beta-male provider. Men who have deemed themselves beta-male providers have no choice but to com mit to receiving any kind of female companionship.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Women do not sleep with men they perceive as beta without some kind of financial incentive, and since the majority of women won&#39;t sleep with a man for cash directly, they&#39;ll do this indirectly through a mutually beneficial relationsh ip, which is usually a man providing most of the financial support. As previously stated, every man has the choice b etween accepting the role of a beta-male provider and finding women who view him as an alpha male.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The only thing that makes a man have a sexual market value often is if he thinks he&#39;s a ten. I think I&#39;m a ten; therefor e, I&#39;m a ten. But how can that be if I can&#39;t sleep with every woman I want? It&#39;s not about sleeping with every woman; it&#39;s about accepting the fact that every woman can&#39;t find you attractive. Once you understand that, you&#39;ll never let rej ection deter you again. This fearlessness of rejection forever prohibits you from accepting a woman who views you as a beta male for anything other than a sex partner. So what&#39;s ultimately the end game? The end game is to know th ere&#39;s never an end game! We&#39;re all living in a social media purgatory!</p></body></html>
