I can't speak for women, but I know for a fact that most men lose all of their identity in a relationship. When a man f inds a woman he likes, he drifts away from his friends, interests, hobbies, and purpose to spend more time with his woman. No woman wants to be the centerpiece of a man's life. Women think they want to be the centerpiece, but wh en you make them the centerpiece, they slowly lose interest in you. You want a woman to complain that the two of y ou don't spend enough time together.
